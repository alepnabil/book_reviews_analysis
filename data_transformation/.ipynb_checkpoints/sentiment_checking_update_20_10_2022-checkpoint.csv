Czarny Pies,"Both conclusions methodology ""Leviathan"" shocking modern reader. Writing seventeenth century, Hobbes attacked medieval political philosophy religion. However, unlike enlightenment philosophers base arguments classical authors Greece Rome. Instead made clear considered much wrong medieval scholastics. Thus starting zero, Hobbes developed doctrine every nation commonwealth requires undivided sovereign. To contemporary reader, Hobbes seems arguing would best living totalitarian regime. In Hobbes view men evil wishing instinct dominate exploit fellow men. Hence every commonwealth needs ruled strong sovereign protect members commonwealth other. The sovereign single person, aristocracy democracy. The single person system best allows complete concentration power. For Hobbes king tyrant thing. Thus Greeks Romans classical era wrong praise tyrannicide condemn regicide. Both equally wrong. The crime long parliament executed Charles I, divinely chosen King England, killed sovereign ensured civil war would resume England. Cromwell's great virtue ended war protected English population. The supremet good commonwealth member support sovereign. With goal demonstrating doctrine divine right kings nonsense, Hobbes devotes two four books Leviathan proving religion absurd. He fills pages referring contradictions absurdities Christian bible. He points way properly determine texts belong bible not. Even one believes God, one deal second problem way prove claims claim speak God indeed representatives. Finally, Hobbes points doctrine divine right kings defended Roman Catholic Church basis scripture. Protestants, however, little reason happy Hobbes also demonstrates many doctrines also lack basis scripture. Despite audacity vigour, posterity kind Hobbes. Absolutism totalitarianism dirty words today's society. The political thinkers eighteenth century returned classical theory proposed many authors eloquently Polybius ideal situation power state divided king, aristocracy democratically elected assembly. The problem course easier argue Hobbes fight totalitarianism's instinctive appeal. In times crisis, people tend support strong dictators like Franco, protectors like Cromwell strong men like Putin.","2,412 reviews

امیر لطیفی,هدفِ اصلی کتاب پاسخ به این پرسش است: چرا به دولت نیاز داریم؟ هابز برای انسان حقی را تعریف می‌کند به عنوانِ «حقِ طبیعی». حقِ طبیعی یعنی حقِ حفظِ منافع که می‌تواند منجر به قدرت‌طلبی و تجاوز به حقوقِ دیگران شود. در نتیجه هابز «وضعِ طبیعی» را وضعِ «جنگ همه علیه همه» می‌داند. و از اینجا به لزوم بکارگیریِ «قانونِ طبیعی» می‌رسد تا بتوان به مددِ آن حقوق‌ِ انسان‌ها را حفظ کرد و آن‌ها را مجاب و مجبور کرد که به حقوقِ دیگران تجاوز نکنند. هابز با بسطِ این مفاهیم دولت را نهادی می‌داند که باید همه به نفعِ آن و با هدفِ حفظِ امنیت و حقوق‌شان، بخشی از حقوق‌شان را به آن واگذار کنند. دولتِ ایده‌آل و موفق از نظرِ هابز، دولتی‌ست مقتدر و محق به انجام هر کاری. چرا که اراده‌ی دولت در عمل اراده‌ی اشخاصی‌ست که برخی از حقوقِ خود را به آن واگذار کرده‌اند. و کسی حق ندارد نماینده‌ی محقِ خود را از حقوق‌اش محروم کند. بخش اعظمی از کتاب در مورد دولتِ مسیحی در تقابل با دولتِ ظلمت است. هابز می‌کوشد که ریشه‌های دولت را در مسیحیت جستجو کند. این از جمله بخش‌هایی‌ست که می‌توان آن را روزنامه‌وار خواند. در شروعِ کتاب هابز از انسان و حرکت صحبت می‌کند. حسیات، امیال، خیال، تفکر و همه چیز را براساس نوعی حرکت یا سکون در انسان شرح می‌دهد. لویاتان نامِ موجودی خیالی و ترسناک است، استعاره‌‌ از دولت. به نظرِ هابز انسان‌ها بدون ترس خود را نسبت به هیچ قرارداری متعهد نمی‌دانند. پس دولت باید هر جا لازم باشد با توسل به ترس و زور کارش را پیش ببرد.,"155 reviews

David Sarkies,"A Monster Book 12 Oct 2017 Woah, three weeks I finally managed finish behemoth book (which, ironically, Hobbes also wrote book name) I move onto something much lighter. Anyway, time, I younger, I dreaming one day getting married, children, becoming hot shot lawyer (is possible actually two things) I wanted read proposed child (or she) still baby. Mind you, I suggested one Christian friends, proceeded heart attack claiming humanist text similar writings . Mind you, particular person lecturer English Literature Harvard University I still wondering hugely shocked idea. Maybe something wanting read baby. Anyway, apparently book laid foundation political science know today, though I sort scratching head suggestion. First people writing politics since people first tossed unelected kings began argue best way run country, Mind you, particular people, , pretty quickly came conclusion letting mob make rules principle popularity pretty bad idea decided go back drawing board work system smart people actually run country. Mind you, Classics history lecturer told us, problem idea smart people actually much better things running country. Okay, maybe Plato, smart person, would perfect position, seemed end spending time trying teach rulers smart ruler, failing abysmally. As turned out, smart ruler particularly easy thing do, end much easier collect taxes use said taxes build palaces go around beating people like. At least right idea. Hobbs seems follow Plato's opinion, though go far Machiavelli actually telling rulers successful rulers. Rather spends time exploring nature government, instead coming unworkable ideas, basically looks around him, traditions past, come conclusion best form government monarchical government based upon principles scripture. His theory basically God sovereign, God perfect ruler, ergo best form government Christian king. However, I mentioned, book pretty chunky, half deals theological exposition Bible supports monarchy. Well, quite come back point book Samuel Israelites demand king, main reason happens Israelites decided living constitution God laid little hard, seems nations around awful lot fun, live like them. Well, us know Bible know turned out. A little context probably order though. Hobbes wrote book English Civil war, incredibly messy affair. Basically Catholic monarch one side wanting things way, protestant parliament side basically telling bugger mind business. Things got messier, messier, resulted Charles basically head lopped off. Well, particularly solve anything because, much like French revolution, left power vacuum. Well, quite, Oliver Cormwell, turned effective succession plan place, end, Cormwell died, son took over, resultant mess ended asking king come back take over. Hobbes' ideas probably sit well called advanced Democracies days, look landed President United States – Reality TV star. Okay, actor elected President, least Reagan tried true union man (if consider Screen Actors Guild union, serious – is). Mind you, Australia can't comment elected Tony Abbott – misogynist asked felt LGBT community, reply 'they make feel uncomfortable'. Actually, asked comment Australian soldier killed Afghanistan, reply 'shit happens' (I kid not). Well, least say typical Australian response. Mind you, I'm big fan totalitarianism, admit whole democratic experiment, least west, pretty messed up. Well, quite, Germans seemed worked quite well, seem chugging along quite happily. Even British seem reasonably level headed people power (and whatever think Teresa May, least nowhere near bad Tony Abbot, Trumpet matter). Yet, despite Hobbes really applicable times, way is. He looking country complete mess solution go back tried true method – king – certainly better people running around shooting other. Maybe could solve problems asking Angela Merkel come sort us out. Hey, least Norwegians made sure mining companies actually paid minerals took lands – simply let take them. If I walk shop start helping goodies I'd arrested. I guess matra 'jobs, growth, opportunity' gets days.","1,756 reviews

Alp Turgut,"Türkiye İş Bankası Yayınları’nın ""Thomas Hobbes"" biyografisini okuduktan sonra okuduğum için ünlü düşünürün felsefesini anlamakta zorluk çekmeden okuduğum ""Leviathan"", özellikle ""İnsan Üzerine”"" ""Devlet Üzerine"" olan ilk iki bölümüyle neden okunması gereken felsefi başyapıtlar arasında olduğunu ortaya koyuyor. Özgür irade olmadığının altını çizen Hobbes, iradenin özgür olduğunu vurgularken devlet kurumu olmadan insanların yaratılışları itibariyle kontrol altına alınamadığını etkileyici bir şekilde okuyucuya sunuyor. İnsanların özgürlüklerinden vazgeçmeleriyle ancak barışın huzurun sağlanacağını belirten ""Leviathan"", Platoncu monarşik bir devlet anlayışını desteklerken, Aristotelesçi skolastik felsefeyi ağır bir dille eleştiriyor. Doğal yerine ""devlet"" ""yasa"" gibi yapay oluşumları tercih eden Hobbes’un Tanrı dini kavramları maddesel bir zemine yerleştirerek ""inanç"" kavramında çığır açması da yazarı özel kılan unsurlardan. Yazdıklarıyla yozlaşmış katolik kilisenin otoristesini reddederek bir nevi laik düşüncenin önünü açan ""Leviathan""ın son iki bölümünde ise ne yazık ki ilk iki bölümün etkisini bulmak zor. Yine de okudukça yeni şeyler bulduğunuz eserin “hiç kimsenin kazancına veya keyfine zarar vermeyen gerçekler, herkesçe benimsenir.” son cümlesi bile kitabın önemini ortaya koyuyor. Platon, Aristoteles, Cicero, Farabi, Erasmus, Machiavelli, Frances Bacon Thomas More’dan okunması gerektiğini düşündüğüm ""Leviathan"", gerçekten okunması gereken felsefi eserler arasında. 03.05.2018 İstanbul, Türkiye Alp Turgut","393 reviews

Somayeh Fatemi,_ کسی که به صرف لطف کس دیگری سودی عایدش می‌شود باید چنان عمل کند که شخص بخشنده از عملش که مبتنی بر حسن نیت بوده پشیمان نشود. خلاصه تموم شد . خیلی خوشحالم. خیلی. حتما واسه خودم یه هدیه می‌خرم🤪. و اما کتاب کلی درگیری ذهنی ایجاد کرد واسم. بعضی وقت‌ها در مقابل حرف هاش کم میاوردم. خیلی رُک حقیقتُ می‌کوبه به صورت آدم. و یه جاهایی ام احساس کردم نویسنده داره زیرآبی میره تا حرف حرف خودش بشه! کتاب رو به عنوان یک اثر سیاسی می‌شناسن اما ورق که بزنید رگه هایی از انسان شناسی هم می‌بینید. هابز برای اطمینان از برداشت درست مخاطب در مورد زبان شناسی خودش هم حرف می‌زنه که مقصود و منظور از برخی گفته ها و واژه ها چیه. ۵۰۰ صفحه است اما دوبرابر این نکته داره. باید با صبر و تامل بخونید. عجله نکنید. پیشنهادم اینه از کتاب های کمکی هم استفاده کنید. متن یه جاهایی فهم‌ش خیلی سا��ه می‌شه اما گول نخورید پشت این حرف ها، حرف هایی پنهان هست و واقعا منظور اون چیزی نیست که نوشته شده. کتاب های کمکی من: ۱ راهنمای خواندن لویاتان، جانسون بگبی، مجتبی هاتف ۲ اندیشه هابز، ریچارد تاک، حسین بشیریه ۳ هابز، استفان جی.فین، محمد مصحفی ۴ هابز، جورج مک دانلد راس، مسعود آذر فام ۵ فلسفه هابز، مارشال میسنر، خشایار دیهیمی ۶ توماس هابز و سیاست فلسفه طبیعی، استفان جی.فین، زهرا تدین ۷ هابز و آزادی جمهوری خواهانه کوئنتین اسکینر، هرمز همایون فر و بزودی اضافه میکنم که هر کدوم از این کتاب ها چقدر کمک کرده. _ وای به حال زندگان، وا�� به حال مردگان، خوشا به حال آنکس که نه زنده شد و نه مُرد. _ زندگی صرفا حرکت اندام هاست و سرمنشا حرکت هم عمدتا درونی است. _ عقل و درایت نه حاصل مطالعه کتاب ها بلکه نتیجه مطالعه احوال آدمیان است. _ زمان حال تنها در طبیعت وجود دارد، امور گذشته تنها در خاطره وجود دارند، اما امور آینده اصلا وجود ندارند. آینده تنها توهم ذهن است که توالی اعمال گذشته را بذ زمان حاضر اعمال می‌کند. _ آخرین میل در جریان تامل اراده خوانده می‌شود. اگر بخوام ادامه بدم از هیچ خط کتاب نمی‌تونم بگذرم. پیش به سوی بهیموت,"70 reviews

Mahnam,«فراغت مادر فلسفه است و دولت مادر صلح و فراغت.» لویاتان هابز به‌عنوان یکی از اولین نوشته‌های علمی سیاسی که به بررسی و نقد دولت می‌پردازد جایگاه مهمی در اندیشه سیاسی دارد. دو بخش نخست این اثر از ظرافت و دقت خاصی به‌خصوص در حوزه‌ی زبان برخوردار است. همین نکته‌سنجی و بررسی تاحدودی زبان‌شناسانه جذاب‌ترین ویژگی لیواتان را رقم می‌زند. هابز به‌کرات می‌نویسد عدم استفاده درست از واژه‌هاست که انسان را به ورطه‌ی شناخت نادرست و دشمنی‌های بی‌اساس سوق می‌دهد. هم‌چنین به فلاسفه‌ی یونان و میراث‌شان می‌تازد و آن را بیشتر بازی کلامی می‌داند تا بحثی که شناخت را ممکن سازد یا انسان را قدمی به حقیقت نزدیک‌تر کند. با این‌حال، لویاتان ضعف‌هایی دارد چرا که هابز می‌خواهد ثابت کند بهترین وضعیت انسان در وجود یک دولت خلاصه می‌شود که کم‌ترین چندگانگی قدرت را داشته باشد و برای این منظور و باتوجه به برهه‌ی تاریخی زیست خود بهترین شکل حکومت را پادشاهی می‌داند، آن هم یک پادشاهی تمام‌عیار که اختیارات شخص پادشاه در آن حدواندازه ندارد. گاه به‌گاه هابز نتیجه‌گیری‌هایی می‌کند که در واقع هیچ ارتباطی به برهان‌هایش ندارد. مثلا هرچیز موجود در طبیعت را به دولت تعمیم می‌دهد در صورتی که دولت و پیدایش آن ربطی به طبیعت ندارد حتی چنانچه پاسخ منطقی انسان به محیط پیرامونش دانسته شود. در زمینه‌ی اخلاقی اگرچه دیدی نوین داشته و اخلاق را نسبی می‌دیده، به‌منظور حفظ دولت همه‌چیز را قراردادی بررسی می‌کند و‌ لابه‌لای سخنانش می‌گوید که باید از حفره‌های قانونی و قراردادی بهره جست تا بتوان بهتر حکم راند. چنین نوشته‌هایی اگرچه تاحدی واقع‌گرایانه است اما انگار بوی استثمار می‌دهد و به راه‌گشایی و توجیهی برای رفتاری که من آن را انگلیسی می‌نامم، می‌ماند. دو بخش اخر بررسی جوامع مسیحی است و پر از ارجاعات به متون مذهبی که برای خواننده‌ی علاقمند به این حوزه می‌تواند جالب باشد اما برای من نکته‌ی تازه‌ای نداشت چرا که پیش‌تر رساله‌ی الهیاتی سیاسی اسپینوزا را خوانده بودم و اگرچه اسپینوزا از هابز تاثیرپذیرفته، از جسارت بیشتری برخوردار بوده و در نتیجه نقدی تندتر و پرمایه‌تر را به تحریر در آورده است. از متن کتاب: گرچه من برای آن دسته از متقدمینی که صراحتا حقایق را مطرح کرده و یا ما را به‌طریق بهتری برای دستیابی به آن‌ها رهنمون شده‌اند، احترام می‌گذارم لیکن خود را مدیون عهد باستان نمی‌دانم؛ زیرا اگر به قدمت و درازی عمر احترام می‌گذاریم، در آن صورت عصر حاضر قدیمی‌ترین و پر سال‌ترین عصر است و اگر برای قدمت خود نویسندگان احترام قائل می‌شویم، در آن صورت معلوم نیست که نویسندگانی که چنین شأن ومنزلتی به ایشان داده می‌شود وقتی کتب خود را می‌نوشتند، قدیمی‌تر از منی بوده باشند که الآن کتاب می‌نویسم اما اگر نیک بنگریم، تمجید و ستایش نویسندگان قدیم، ناشی از احترام به مردگان نیست بلکه از رقابت و حسادت متقابل در بین زندگان برمی‌خیزد. این بخش از نوشته‌اش عجیب به دلم نشست، به‌راستی که اکثر مواقع بار احترام به پیشینیان مانع از نقد درست و صادقانه‌ی آثار می‌شود؛ هابز خود با جسارت به فلاسفه‌ی پیشین حمله می‌برد و ایراداتی که وارد می‌کند اکثرا درست و به‌جاست. به‌نظرم خواننده باید همین رویه را در پیش بگیرد و بر حیرت و شگفتی خود از آثار گذشته مسلط شود تا بتواند گامی به جلو بردارد. در پایان باید گفت ترجمه‌ی حسین بشیریه بسیار روان است و خوانش این اثر را ساده و هموار می‌سازد.,"Author

Andrew,"Leviathan major work philosophy. Full stop. It's interesting think book fundamental root lot ultra-conservative brains. On level, I understand this. Hobbes defends divine right royal power (to certain extent) proceeds define power absolute. Without question, subjects must bow masters, circumstances. In this, however, ultimately says monarch's power granted subjects, without subjects monarch king nothing, decrees cannot carried out, etc. I remember text book much. I read mostly bus job Domino's Pizza couple years ago. I suppose comforted think deal egomaniacal boss work divine devotion, opposed oppressive hell. The book convince truths needed accepting time, brutality boss work, would ultimately fall, actions became tyrannical enough convince employees fit rule. Which forthwith, subsequently fired. So told me. Another employee told went work Domino's Federal Way, miles south Seattle, seems like suitable enough punishment, feel like I Federal Way (i.e. there? good doing?) Leviathan changed life.

Marts (Thinker),"Thomas Hobbes discourse civil ecclesiatical governance, analyses four parts, firstly via discourse man first principles society; secondly looks institution commonwealth varying principles governing such, listed: ""The sovereign twelve principal rights: 1. successive covenant cannot override prior one, subjects cannot (lawfully) change form government. 2. covenant forming commonwealth results subjects giving sovereign right act them, sovereign cannot possibly breach covenant; therefore subjects never argue freed covenant actions sovereign. 3. sovereign exists majority consented rule; minority agreed abide arrangement must assent sovereign's actions. 4. every subject author acts sovereign: hence sovereign cannot injure subjects cannot accused injustice. 5. sovereign cannot justly put death subjects. 6. purpose commonwealth peace, sovereign right whatever thinks necessary preserving peace security prevention discord. Therefore, sovereign may judge opinions doctrines averse, shall allowed speak multitudes, shall examine doctrines books published. 7. prescribe rules civil law property. 8. judge cases. 9. make war peace sees fit command army. 10. choose counsellors, ministers, magistrates officers. 11. reward riches honour punish corporal pecuniary punishment ignominy. 12. establish laws honour scale worth. "" (got list wikipedia chapter 18 part one) The types commonwealth also considered; monarchy, aristocracy democracy... succession, religion, taxation etc. etc. Thirdly, Hobbes considers 'Christian commonwealth' governance based 'the scriptures', considering discrepancies scriptural civil law... Fourthy, 'kingdom darkness' considered reference ignorance, absence light knowledge. Leviathan written English Civil War Hobbes reiterates views sovereignity social contract theory...

Tristram Shandy,"Scared Shitless Not Witless In autobiography, Thomas Hobbes said mother given “birth twins: fear”, might taken clear hint Hobbes’s mindset pessimistic distrustful man. And yet, Hobbes afraid voice opinions man general organization calls Common-Wealth particular frankness anything bespeak fear pusillanimity time frank matters like especially risky person’s health.

Although probably empiricist strictest sense word, Hobbes allergic kind metaphysical malarkey claims philosophy based clear-cut definitions allow people discuss natural social world terms intersubjective concepts. The prime sources knowledge senses influenced impressions work via certain motions. How motions deciphered interpreted senses, however, question Hobbes leaves dark. One methods recommends order understand man, though, careful introspection. So little wonder Hobbes even comes present origins religion terms psychological needs man, example here: This probably one reasons Hobbes abhorred many full-time do-gooders free-time mythicists world: Hobbes destroys cherished beliefs slams shut door cloud-cuckoo-land, offers us instead might neither flattering soothing. His view man motivated self-interest – culminates survive – rejection natural laws [1] granting life, dignity candy floss unalienable rights every human may insult human vanity – although certainly testify Hobbes’s awareness rules game capitalism. That said, added Hobbes’s radical clear-sightedness fails acknowledge existence certain pre-state powers pacify dominant egocentrism man, religion, [2] social codes behaviour arising human interdependence, whose infringement normally punished peer pressure ostracization, physical consequences. We might applaud process civilization. In Hobbes’s view, however, institution central government – matter form monarch group legislators – form civilization, ideas fall short. Hobbes’s failure consider socio-cultural sources disciplining man’s innate egoism (by appealing via introducing severe disadvantages case anti-social behaviour) reason seems bar right individual’s part resist sovereign power established. Albeit claims sovereign duty protect subjects’ lives well-being, even appears introduce right resistance back-door says Here said many words man may disobey government least need obey law vital interests – Kant others would later it. Of course, Hobbes leaves doubt sovereign exempt form control checks balances, could means accept concept separation powers, I pretty sure one would like live Common-Wealth designed justified Hobbes, least one experienced insecurity lack reliable government civil war. Nevertheless one big one Hobbes justice for, one first modern European philosophers utilitarian idea state government. According state sovereign neither God-given anything eternal ethereal, least super-organism, makes individual find kind sense would never discover individual – know, sort claptrap crap would find German Idealism. In Hobbes’s eyes, government state seem necessary evil, something practical benefit, namely make “life man” less “solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, short.” (p.186) [3] Once much clear, discuss state man-made commodity deciding much central interference ready accept necessary much control individual freedom would like retain. It sense Hobbes essentially modern. All all, reading Hobbes unprepossessed mind could, paradoxically, teach us call question tendencies governments super-governmental institutions trying educate citizens make behave according certain moral principles operating terms meddle people’s daily lives, forever introducing new regulations prescribed terminologies, thus diminishing sphere individual responsibility freedom.

نجيب,اللفياثان كتاب طويل ولكن لن تشعر ابدا بطول فالكتاب ليس فلسفيا وليس سياسيا وليس ملحمة او عملا أدبيا هو خلط من كل ما كتبت ، فكتاب هوبز هذا المقسم الى أربعة اجزاء تحدى فيه سلطان الكنيسة والدين البابوي بشكل لا يصدق في الجزء الاول يتحدث هوبز عن الانسان ، عن أهمية اللغة والحكمة وكيفية التفكير معطيا اول التلميحات لنظرية المثالية في الكتاب بعد ان هئ هوبز للإنسان المثالي ينتقل الى الدولة المثالية عبر ترميزها في وحش بحري أسطوري هو اللفياثان فأيرادات الدولة تمثل دماء الوحش ومفاصلها هي وزراءها اما رأس الوحش فهو زعيم الدولة او ملكها فرؤية هوبز السياسية تتمثل في انتخاب رئيس يدوم مدى الحياة له سلطة تعادل سلطة الاله بل ان هوبز في الجزء الثالث من الكتاب قد أعلن رأس الدولة الاله الأرضي ولا شئ قبل او بعده وفي الجزء الثالث دمر هوبز المعتقد للمسيحي بالكامل مستعملا الإنجيل نفسه لفعل ذلك فقد جعل من الإنجيل خادما لفلسفته وهو امر معاكس لما كات يفعل الفلاسفة من قبله من شاكلة اوغسطين والاكويني ويصف هوبز بأن سلطة رأس الدولة هي فوق كل دين او مبدأ لذا ارى ان هوبز قد رسم شكلا للدولة العلمانية ليكون لول من كتب وهندس بنية الدولة العلمانية بشجاعة يحسد عليها في وقت كانت فيه الكنيسة قوة تضرب كل مهرطق من شاكلة هوبز,"48 reviews

Steven Peterson,"Three essential hallmarks Hobbesian system important: war all, role human rationality ending this; use knowledge/science basis societal engineering. His view state nature--that time government state existed--is unsurprising one understands born year erstwhile invasion Spanish Armada (1588) lived civil turmoil revolution England throughout life. Hobbes begins view human life would inconceivable Greeks--life state nature, time government, laws, state existed. In state, humans equal. In terms physical prowess, course, stronger others. However, weakest, guile, still kill strongest. In sense, equality. Without power government keep people check, though, find quarrels routinely breaking out. The motives threefold: self-gain, safety, reputation (or glory). The result horrible, follows perhaps single well known statement penned Hobbes: ""Hereby manifest, time men live without common Power keep awe, condition called Warre; warre, every man, every man. . . .In condition, place Industry; fruit thereof uncertain; consequently Culture Earth; navigation, use commodities may imported Sea; commodious Building; Instruments moving, removing things require much force; Knowledge face Earth; account Time; Arts; Letters; Society; worst all, continual feare, danger violent death; And life man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, short."" However, fear terror state nature escaped. Humans are, all, according Hobbes, capable reason. Individual reason leads people realize must something escape "". . .Feare Death; Desire things necessary commodious living; Hope Industry obtain them."" Furthermore, human reason allows individuals understand laws nature. This defined Hobbes "". . .a Precept, general Rule, found Reason, man forbidden do, that, destructive life, taketh away means preserving same."" To preserve life, fruits industry might gained peace, human reason lets people realize giving freedoms, liberties, rights order establish system end perpetual war all. The mechanism ""social contract,"" people state nature covenant one another form powerful government, powerful suppress individuals' efforts seek self-advantage state nature. A ""Leviathan"" needed. However, state ceases protect people's lives, contract voided; revolution acceptable option citizenry then. However, price terrible, dissolution state, people plunged back nightmare state nature. They would re-enact contract escape ravages perpetual war. Key points Hobbes: focus individual rather society, hence individualistic system; human reason considered central attaining peace harmony; humans perceive essence natural laws powers reason; contracting one another, people control destinies produce environment find commodious living fruitfully. An important early work development Modern thinking liberal political thought. A must read work interested Western political philosophy.","Author

Xander,"In Leviathan (1651), Hobbes builds earlier works offer contemporaries solution horrors English Civil War: authoritarian dictatorship. How succesful Hobbes convincing contemporaries beyond knowledge, I know Hobbes treated black sheep even death. A huge part treatment origins Hobbes' materialistic (and, according contemporarties: atheist) philosophy, I can't shake belief Hobbes' plea absolute sovereignty perceived threat nobility clergy alike. I go Hobbes' philosophy (see earlier review 1641 book, The Elements Law, Natural Politic). Suffice say Hobbes starts pessimistic view man nature: perpetual war all, place industry society. To end horrible state nature, mankind agrees give right defending (i.e. using violence other) collectively transfer power absolute sovereign. This sovereign absolute, sense legislative executive power. There's lot say Hobbes' picture state, I review. To name two examples, Hobbes seems confidence absolute monarchy - seem fan aristocracy, let alone democracy. This understandable: Hobbes friends high (royal) circles, protected persecution religious zealots, maybe plain honest wishing old pre-Civil War situation restored (England ruled royal family). According Hobbes', monarchy stable; maybe different opinion 21st century, lived prosperous peaceful democracies century. Anyway, I moralize historical works. A second interesting point that, even though half Leviathan concerned religion, Hobbes seems attack Christianity outright. I'm talking materialist philosophy, view power. Hobbes promotes dictatorship: sovereign power (be aristocracy, monarchy democracy) decides goes; church obey. If there's conflict interest church state, good Christians obey state. In effect, Hobbes transferring church power sovereign - wonder Christian contemporaries furious! How Hobbes legitimate claim? Well, dsitinguish heavenly earthly power. The sovereign (preferably king) rules earthly state; church power concerning spiritual powers. A good Christian believe Jesus Chirst obey laws - Hobbes God's laws natural laws, according state run. The church power sovereign. It hard understand importance Leviathan modern-day readers: us used living secular countries. But really first major (historical) step towards secular state; Hobbes, convincing philosophical justification seperation church state. This trend later social contract/political writers like Spinoza, Locke Rousseau would follow. Leviathan hard follow times, general seems outdated abstract. It important historical document though. This makes worth reading (maybe parts). -------- On re-read I feel like I understand Hobbes' train thoughts much thorough, especially intricate connection conception matter, man state. On material level, Hobbes' materialism means humans that, matter motion. He explains passions impressions external objects internal states, deliberation train passions acting it, final passion acted out. On higher level, state Leviathan, Sovereign Absolute Power translates natural law civil law, this, guides society path peace prosperity. Leviathan, referring Book Job, name well-chosen: Pride Vanity two common dangerous passions Man, lead strife. According Hobbes, State Artificial Man, particular organs, limbs, functions. It still unclear Hobbes' stance religion. His doctrines seem counter religious doctrines fundamental points, yet almost half Leviathan dedicated religion, pointing Catholic Church notion Kingdom God still come, (so claim Universal Authority Kings, misguided deceitful) Hobbes uses countless examples interpretations Scripture. Interesting thoughts: fulminating Catholic Church Scottish Church, well Universities 'Kingdome Darkness' muddled deceitful doctrines. He destroys Aristoteleanism simple statement whole philosophy based concepts signify Nothing. Essences, entities, essentialities, etc. nothing empty words - truth houses method resolution (analysis) composition (synthesis): breaking things parts building things components. We see here, Hobbes, radical break past, happening time Galileo, Descartes Gassendi (whom Hobbes met various European Tours). And historical fact, epic radical thoughts contained Leviathan, completeness consistency, well literary value - makes appreciate Hobbes Leviathan more. I glad I re-read it, I adjust perception philosophy book particular. Book 1: The workings nature man - materialism, passions, virtues vices, state nature, natural laws, institution state/introduction morality. Book 2: The commonwealth - Sovereign, Absolute Power, conditions threats commonwealths, civil law justice, workings social body (political bodies, justice, economics, taxation, education, ministers, councils, etc.). Book 3: The role place Church - subservient State. Sovereign God's servant, Church not. Sovereign determines freedom individuals, also Church doctrines. Censorship State-religion. Illustration Biblical books. Book 4: The corruption Catholic Presbyterian Churches; delusionial Schools Universities.","386 reviews

Canon,"""But purpose, may man say, subtlety work nature, I pretend nothing necessary doctrine government obedience? It purpose, men may longer suffer abused doctrine 'separated essences,' built vain philosophy Aristotle, would fright obeying laws country, empty names; men fright birds corn empty doublet, hat, crooked stick."" Somewhere twilight zone Hobbes' refutation Cardinal Bellarmine's political theology Book III, Chapter 42, I asked myself: ""Why hell reading this? Your Bookish Persona named Canon, yet must read Work Philosophical merely Canonical Estimation? Wait — hell you, I, talking like this?!"" Well, I say I read spirit Hobbes' desired-for ""sovereign consider himself... exercise entire sovereignty, protecting public teaching it, convert truth speculation utility practice."" That is, I already knew Hobbes's absolutism, I come search political philosophy implement. The catalyst finally reading behemoth (haha) completely seeing Hobbes entertainingly pooh-poohed Davids Graeber & Wengrow James C. Scott (Affable Anarchists All) in, respectively, . In different project (indeed, aforementioned anarchists would doubtless conniptions placed printed proximity next thinker), A.C. Grayling puts Hobbes anti-clerical movement Enlightenment book , I also enjoyed reading earlier year. So there'd references Hobbes recent reading, interest grew. But backdrop recent interest, I'd wanting read purely completist addiction, something I yet gotten control (help!). I'd read excerpts past, time finally come Thomas I take ""a pleasant walk, pleasant talk,"" although briny breeze involved since I live, coast itself, inland peninsula. - One badass original book covers time: - Hobbes's diabolical joy central metaphor state-as-body (or ""body politic""), goes further, making state body, God. I appreciate simplicity insidiousness image. But Hobbes makes state like individual body, elevates authority individual Theorist writ large State. Thus, I enjoyed reading literary fantasy entitled - Hobbes's colorful use images metaphors general. One stuck mind Hobbes describes warlike state nature terms tendencies foul weather (this near famous nasty, brutish, short passage). - Hobbes' encyclopedic lists. I'm sucker lists, presence Goodreads attests. Just look list. I enjoyed Hobbes's lists, lists lists, appearance exhaustive learnedness (but, reality, idiosyncratic arbitrariness) conveyed. - Hobbes's nominalist apoplexy ancient scholastic philosophers, I find completely agreeable, even admirable negative movement. Hobbes Schopenhauer levels sass absurd idiotic philosophers like are. For example: - Hobbes's diatribes authority Church. Part III, despite maddening length morass biblical exposition (that is, appeal reasons I, modern secular reader, care less about), persuasively argues Church subordinate Civil power, even though (a fatal flaw) Hobbes's Civil power tyrannical Church attacks. - Hobbes's obsession demonology, occult, witchcraft, ghosts, magic, gods, fairies, incantations, exorcisms, etc., threats civil society. Whenever started beliefs demons magic, albeit condemn all, I lost interest actual argument, wished I reading 17th century demonology instead. One snarky metaphors (in book full snark obsessively developed metaphors) compares Catholic church kingdom fairies. Here's example threat Hobbes sees belief spirits: ""If superstitious fear spirits taken away, prognostics dreams, false prophecies, many things depending thereon, crafty ambitious persons abuse simple people, men would much fitted civil obedience."" - Hobbes example thinker no-nonsense, almost Lego-like realist metaphysics epistemology sense impressions — solid block world stands externally, like Sovereign, Authority Common Denominator. - Relatedly, Hobbes's comparative philosophy like levels video game —, let's say, every world built Template Reality merely interesting cosmetics laid give appearance variety really difference diversity. Hobbes understands underlying Template thus measures cultures societies single essential line, (let's run silly comparison, Hobbes does) like Spyro purple dragon empty worlds completely make sterile. At end measuring line Hobbes himself, fullest, non-deluded teacher Truth. - How Hobbes shows necessary interrelationship Absolutism Relativism, that, within dichotomy posited, brute power decisive. Against many things I noted ""like"" column, let outweigh all: Hobbes's admirable attacks philosophical dogma ecclesiastical authority ultimately purpose establishing even greater tyranny absolute sovereign rightful control thoughts actions subjects, power never rejected, ever criticized, fall away tantamount barbarity damnation: ""And name tyranny signifieth nothing less name sovereignty, one many men, saving use former word understood angry call tyrants; I think toleration professed hatred tyranny toleration hatred Commonwealth general, another evil seed, differing much former.""","491 reviews

Yann,"Le Leviathan est un livre remarquable. Écrit par un Anglais au beau milieu du dix-septième siècle, alors qu'en France la Fronde secoue la paix du royaume, que l'Angleterre est également la proie de troubles, et qu'enfin l'Europe est encore meurtrie par les guerres de religion, cet ouvrage pour ambition de tracer nettement la frontière entre les prérogatives de la Religion chrétienne et celles de l’État, quand à l'usage des lois, et de la force pour les faire respecter. Hobbes peut être compté parmi le petit nombre de ces auteurs qui ne cherchent pas à en imposer avec les fumées d'un vain savoir, paré de jargon et d'importance, mais cherche au contraire à ramener la lumière, là où la malice profité des ténèbres de l'ignorance pour prospérer. Les définitions abondent, sont agrémentées d'exemples, les étymologies sont épluchées consciencieusement, les raisonnements sont serrés: il pose ses hypothèses puis chasse les incohérences. On ne s'étonnera pas du fait que Hobbes fut un lecteur assidu de Thucydide , tant sa lecture du monde est à la fois sombre et réaliste. La nature du pouvoir est expliquée avec le même esprit d'objectivité et d'utilité. On trouvera même les idées les plus fortes de ""L'essai sur l'entendement humain"" de Locke , ce qui n'a pas laissé de surprendre et de m'impressionner.

Λευτέρης Πετρής,"""Οι πράξεις των ανθρώπων πηγάζουν από τις απόψεις τους. Η φύση διαιρεί έτσι τους ανθρώπους που τους παρωθεί να αλληλοσυγκρούονται και να αλληλοεξοντώνονται. Κάθε άνθρωπος επιδιώκει εκ φύσεως το προσωπικό του όφελος και προαγωγή. Αν δύο άνθρωποι επιθυμούν το ίδιο πράγμα, χωρίς εν τούτοις να μπορούν αμφότεροι να το αποκτήσουν, γίνονται εχθροί. Και στην πορεία προς τον σκοπό τους (που είναι κυρίως η αυτοσυντήρηση, αλλά και ορισμένες φορές η ευχαρίστησή τους ��όνο) προσπαθούν να καταστρέψουν ή να υποτάξουν ο ένας τον άλλο. Για να αποκτήσουν νόημα τα ονόματα δίκαιο και άδικο πρέπει να υπάρξει μια εξαναγκαστική εξουσία, που να επιβάλλει σε όλους εξίσου την τήρηση των συμβάσεων, απειλώντας τους με τιμωρία μεγαλύτερη του οφέλους που προσδοκούν να αποκτήσουν από την αθέτησή τους. Χωρίς το φόβο της επακόλουθης ποινής ο νόμος δεν θα ήταν παρά κενά λόγια. Σκοπός της ποινής δεν είναι η εκδίκηση και η εκτόνωση της οργής, αλλά ο σωφρονισμός, τόσο του παραβάτη όσο και άλλων, με το παράδειγμά του. Οι άνθρωποι οφείλουν να τηρούν τις συμβάσεις τους.""","Author

Gary Beauregard Bottomley,"The Open Syllabus Project, systematic study one million college syllabi ranks book seventh popular book cited syllabi. After listened book I know exactly why. The Age Enlightenment starts book. It's clear project Enlightenment dialectic answering pessimism Hobbes optimism John Locke. They might agree Hobbes, respond him. Hobbes subtle arguments. The time period still believes witches superstition, beliefs based authority. Hobbes not. The strength Hobbes arguments understands knowledge is, absolute knowledge means, misleading 'belief in' 'faith' foundations understanding explaining. Hobbes advanced way putting nature knowledge firm foundation. Chronologically Hobbes comes Bacon Galileo Newton, laying foundation Newton think knowledge Universal, Necessary Certain explaining understanding natural world. (Newton laws gravity see world terms Kant, Heidegger Kuhn much later show knowledge best thought particular, contingent probable). Hobbes also subtle arguments. He absolute authoritarian comes power vested sovereign. I realize Richard Nixon David Frost interviews argued chief executive could possibly break law would think Nuremberg defense reasonable (Hobbes would defend both). Even muddle arguments sometimes real gems wisdom pop out. For example, man trusted job line, influential widely known responsible inciting violence unknown. There two things I know certainty: 1) everyone listen (or read) book, 2) nobody listen third chapter book (probably 8 hours long), one commonwealth church. The third chapter way many bible verses I would say Enlightenment ignored chapter part one exception. I recently read ""Age Reason"" Thomas Paine, obvious first edition book took Hobbes chapter three used show bible holy also directly restates Hobbes points revelation God always second hand everyone person speaks directly God. An aside, seemed obvious Hobbes atheist (or deist), never would explicit it. Though, dreaded third chapter (please skip can!) really interested showing ""papist' less authority Church England. I really can't understate obvious importance book jump starting Age Enlightenment. The book dry (and dryly read), sprinkled book real pearls wisdom. This book deserves seventh cited book college syllabi. My hesitation recommending book 3rd chapter endless bible citations. Don't skip fourth chapter. There real elegant refutation Aristotelian thought danger appealing authority reason. After all, Age Enlightenment readily described rejecting authority primary source knowledge appealing reason instead.","919 reviews

ValeBooks,"Para Hobbes la comunidad al ser creada constituida por el soberano es un hecho externo, por eso es algo artificial totalizante. Representativa de un constante aumento del desacuerdo en cuanto los significados comunes fundamentales, en tal sentido nos permite ver que precaria era, para Hobbes la distancia entre estado de naturaleza sociedad civil. El estado de naturaleza simboliza solo un extremo de desorden en las relaciones humanas... Un estado subjetivo solo de la carencia de un poder soberano. Para Hobbes la razón política es sinónimo de verdad sino más bien de certidumbre. Considero que dicha idea esta en crisis, como lo demuestra el derrumbe de los socialistas reales de los sistemas totalitarios. Me parece que un nuevo paradigma de la política debe recoger la incertidumbre como un principio constitutivo de la comunidad, de la democracia de la propia política. Se trata por tanto, de libertad al hombre, justamente, de poder externo.","46 reviews

Cudetona,"“Deus Mortal”: dispensável ou necessário? O Leviatã é um monstro marinho lendário, com aspecto de serpente marinha feral, descrito Antigo Testamento. Suas características físicas variam de acordo com os livros bíblicos, podendo absorver forma de um peixe, dragão, crocodilo ou polvo. Em “Leviatã”, de Thomas Hobbes (1588 – 1679), porém, esse monstro possui uma forma extremamente peculiar – e assustadora – de uma organização social, conhecida e chamada pelo filósofo por Estado. O livro é dividido em quatro partes: A Respeito Homem; A Respeito Estado; Do Estado Cristão e Do Reino das Trevas. A terceira e quarta partes são compostas majoritariamente por análises dos textos bíblicos, e não precisam ser lidas por aqueles que não possuem interesse nesse assunto (por serem mais longas e repetitivas). A metodologia de raciocínio de Hobbes é, perceptivelmente, diferente da de outros filósofos gênero. Ele trata construção de argumentos de forma quase matemática. Para pensador, arte discurso consiste em estabelecer relações lógicas entre os conceitos e definições, assim como cálculo. Portanto, da mesma forma que um matemático pode se enganar e encontrar falsos resultados em suas operações, é possível também ao filósofo se equivocar e chegar em falsas conclusões. Isso ocorre pelo fato de que capacidade humana de raciocínio é limitada, e qualquer pessoa pode se iludir em premissas erradas. Com esse pensamento, ele inicia sua longa argumentação com que chama de “definições”: conceitos das palavras que serão mais recorrentes, para assim evitar ambiguidades e duplas interpretações. Para ele, discursos que não possuam definições ou sejam recheados de metáforas podem ser enganadores e não devem ser admitidos. Com uma visão de coerção social antagônico ao de Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Hobbes acredita que estado fundamental das relações humanas não é de paz, como acreditava francês, mas sim de guerra. O Estado, portanto, serve para amenizar esses conflitos, e garantir justiça, que autor bem define como garantia de cumprimento dos pactos. Isso se deve ao fato de que os humanos são movidos principalmente por paixões e emoções (e não pela razão), e força das palavras é demasiada fraca para que os homens respeitem por si mesma. Para Hobbes, relações humanas são regidas por chamadas “leis naturais”, definidas por regras que todos os homens devem seguir de forma manter paz. Assim, qualquer atitude que busque guerra (por lucro, vingança ou reputação) vai contra leis naturais. Essas regras se fincam na máxima da filosofia cristã: “Ame próximo como ama-te ti mesmo”, para que os homens se tratem como iguais. O Estado, pela descrição acima, seria única forma de garantir manutenção dessas leis por todos (existem soldados armados prontos para punir aquele que desrespeitá-las). Existe, porém, uma razoável diferença entre leis civis e leis naturais. As leis civis são aquelas descritas por uma força soberana (mesmo que não seja monárquica), e devem ser registradas e interpretadas por assembleias ligadas ao Estado. As leis naturais, entretanto, são escritas por Deus e fazem parte da própria interação humana, e, portanto, não precisam ser anotadas, e são levadas como premissa em qualquer julgamento. Vale citar que uma lei civil nunca deve ser aplicada sobre força soberana, uma vez que essa tem poder de criar ou revogar leis ao seu bem entender. Dessa forma, qualquer súdito que possua desejo de condenar ou acusar Estado não detém tal poder, já que isso seria uma injúria si mesmo e os indivíduos se classificam como autores de qualquer injustiça, pelo próprio fato de serem servos. A semelhança entre e , de Nicolau Maquiavel, é evidente (exceto pela terceira e quarta partes, nas quais existe forte conotação religiosa). Pelo fato de ambos os autores ocuparem contextos históricos e temas de escrita semelhantes, obras podem se complementar. Apesar da semelhança, Maquiavel busca principalmente aconselhar um monarca sobre como agir em tempos de paz ou guerra para garantir lealdade de seus súditos. Por outro lado, Hobbes possui como objetivo analisar lex e jus civis essenciais para formação de um Estado, e quais outros conceitos são importantes para sua compreensão. Concluindo, livro pode ser resumido pela famosa frase de Thomas Hobbes: “O Estado é um mal necessário”. A leitura de é recomendada para todos que possuem interesse na área de história e filosofia política. É um livro essencial para entendimento contexto absolutismo monárquico e da formação dos Estados Nacionais europeus. O livro é um excelente treinamento para quem deseja ler textos mais complexos futuro. Em minha opinião pessoal, maioria das conclusões de Hobbes são falsas, especialmente que consta às relações entre homem e Estado. O Contrato Social entre súditos e soberanos é (na maioria das vezes) unilateral, fator que é completamente ignorado pelo autor decorrer de suas argumentações. Além disso, discordo da existência de leis naturais, que, para ele, são intrínsecas ao ser humano, pelo próprio fato de que existência de uma natureza humana é questionável com advento da filosofia moderna e da psicologia evolutiva. Ademais, acredito que Hobbes não foi capaz de aplicar sua própria metodologia de pensamento para provar existência de Deus ou de suas consequências (leis e direitos naturais). Isso parece uma contradição, já que esse tipo premissa não deveria ser admitida num discurso matemático.","5 reviews

Muath Aziz,"Read review first read book yet: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... #Of Man#: No free will, soul, machines like ball slope, falls expectedly (it can't Will go down). Imagination Memory; decaying Senses propagate inside heads. #Of Common-Wealths#: Read above-mentioned review. ----- #Of A Christian Common-Wealth#: Now links said Of Man (the world us mechanical, Metaphysics Ghosts etc) said Of Common-Wealths (submit Sovereign Obey him) Christianity said consistent it. As linking Of Man, interpretation Religion civil thing ""organized/institutionalized religion"" interesting consistent! Everything mechanical/not-metaphysical. No Heaven Hell, Demons, Angels (actually new testament eternal creatures called Angels old testament Angel simply means God's action, claims). But sorta soul free (it seems means metaphorically, Church like living man), pp497 interpretation church Civil Council says ""And last sense Church taken one Person [Sovereign]; say, said power will, pronounce, command, obeyed, make laws..."" Jesus' second coming means Ruler, Ruler God's Kingdom, kingdom literally! Heaven God's Kingdom. The citizens state called Christians. The Bible (according Hobbes) says sinners die eternity go Hell eternity (biologically everyone dies eternity, metaphysical Soul lives forever). Hell underground, grave Hell people died (for eternity) go to. Hell fire sinners Jews used do, big fire kept feeding wood never put out, used burn Idolaters (Traitor God's Kingdom, Traitors Common-Wealth) ""Hell"". All interpretation backed references Bible actually makes sense, believed Hobbes' mechanical view World. As linking Of Common-Wealths, ""submit Sovereign Obey him"" Bible says following prophets. So after-Protestant-Movement England (Hobbes Royalist, supported King established separate Church [Church traditional sense]), justifies getting rid Pope Rome, since England independent Common-Wealth, independent Church [Church Hobbes sense]. It's dangerous one Sovereign, Churches [in traditional/spiritual sense] leads Civil Sovereign (the King) Spiritual Sovereign (the Pope), not-a-sole-power, leads wars shows Of Common-Wealth. Now people governed Abraham Moses prophets Civil-Sovereigns, took Civil-Laws directly God, thus citizens required follow scriptures (the Common-Wealth constitution written God prophets) since scriptures Sovereigns wrote Civil-Law. Moses many prophets Spiritual Civil Leaders/Sovereigns. As citizens live Sovereigns God speak to, ought follow Sovereign's Civil-Law whatever (even inconsistent Bible), justified On Common-Wealth (Covenant/Social-Contract). Scriptures strictly followed Sovereign Canonize (even then, Sovereign one ought interpret Scriptures likes), Hobbbes gives example Canonized Scripture English King. When Jesus descends becomes Sovereign Common-Wealth, citizens ought follow like Sovereign (since Jesus God, Civil-Law/State-Constitution new Bible lol). So question is, people required follow prophet God witness Miracles? I'll try link things together: showed Of Man, Believe someone saying, means Opinion says true. As says Of Christian Common-Wealth, someone claims Prophet, Sovereign allowed Believe not, approving word Law. If did, citizens ought follow Sovereign belief. They allowed follow prophet falsified Sovereign, justified power Covenant. If, case Moses, people State Nature (there Sovereign) believed Moses made Contract/Covenant assign Sovereign. But complicated that, Check Religion Tolerance I wonder God sent Prophet Common-Wealth own, Hobbes think people already Sovereign required follow him? It seems (as I think, consistent Hobbes already said), power Covenant (as shown Of Man Of Common-Wealths). So I think Hobbes, Laws Nature > Prophet (he explicitly says Bible explicitly shows Jesus asking followers continue obeying Infidel Sovereigns). He claims Laws Nature come God, thus God telling us follow Prophet already gave Natural Rights Sovereign (follow Spiritually Civilly). To put simply, allowed follow (Civilly) neither Prophet Jesus already Sovereign, Prophets Jesus Sovereign, unless Sovereign approves (Sovereigns that, surrendering another Sovereign) make Covenant (remember Sovereign, shown Of Common-Wealths, still Natural Rights Covenant made subjects subjects to-be-Sovereign). This consistent Moses (after made Sovereign Jews) making Contract God. So Hobbes explicitly expresses belief Christianity? Because, said many times, Sovereign (England King) believes Christianity approves it. To precise, saying believes Sovereign interpretation Christianity (England King says listen Pope Rome example). So make reciprocal contradiction, Hobbes follows Christianity Sovereign follows Sovereign Christianity's ""submit Sovereign Obey him""? Of course not! Remember Hobbes justified ""submit Sovereign Obey him"" Of Common-Wealth philosophically afterwards mentioned Christianity show saying consistent (that consistent Sovereign believes). Technically, Hobbes system fall Sovereign believed another Religion (or simply made new Law) says ""do submit Sovereign Obey him"". Or make extreme example (since Sovereign power interpret Religion): When Sovereign explicitly says ""you allowed follow one Sovereign"", Hobbes system logical contradiction (A=B B, A=B&C --> logical contradiction!), fun lol. In conclusion, Religion vs Common-Wealth (Civil/Politics) duality dangerous. Secularism mutes Religion Politics (takes Politics makes personal choice). Hobbes solution show Religion = Common-Wealth (God's Kingdom = Israel) thus longer duality. No wonder say Enlightenment came proper understanding Christianity. Also, claim Man'a Nature Evil Civil (rules jungle, Laws Nature), Men come together decide make Society, I claim assures Personal Rights individuals. Aristotle claims Man's Nature Civil, thus born Society norm, leads not-assuring Personal Rights Property etc. Hobbes harsh claim fact opened door Human Social Contracts, in: ""hey, want agree live society? Give individual rights!"" ----- Religion Tolerance: Hobbes saying St. Paul saying man ought obey Sovereign even infidel, man ought obey non-Sovereign Minsters Christ. Ministers Christ power punish sinner non-believers. But then, Sovereign bans Christian Belief? Hobbes said many times earlier part one make sense, Man believe internally something express externally something else. Sovereign right decide Religion taught schools universities, right interpret Scriptures, right allow public worship Religion (or Tolerable Religions). But personal belief technically protected, says Hobbes: You can't force someone's heart. You can't open Church Sovereign says no, pray home! So consistent obeying God (infidel) Sovereign? Hobbes (and Martin Luther) says Salvation requires belief Jesus Christ. So, whatever Sovereign tells do, can't inconsistent Christianity's Salvation, need Priest confess Sins to. ----- #Of The Kingdom Of Darkness#: Hobbes gave Interpretation Bible Materialist. He justified right Interpreting Bible. He shows false Catholic Interpretation is. He part shows corrupt Interpretation comes (from Converted Pagans, view Catholicism held Muslims). He also heavily attacks Aristotle Philosophy Christian Universities following without understanding (even understood fully, still full Shit). ""[Metaphysics] Books written, placed [Aristotle] Natural Philosophy: But Schools take Books supernatural Philosophy: word Metaphysics bear senses. And indeed written, part far possibility understood, repugnant thing understood it, must needs think supernatural"" ----- Some non-Politics points: We can't think without Language. From get Language? God taught Adam names. Philosophy Reasoning. It done Logically/Geometrically. It's ok Reason Effects Cause, way around, Causes Effect (Deduction/Analytical vs Induction/Syntactical, I think). Though ""Geometrical"" way Hobbes following book, used support Empiricism (he likes Bacon translated works). But Geometrism Empiricism necessarily mutual exclusive? I think so, Geometrism means precise word definitions list axioms build Logical way (no Sophism), I think consistent even Induction (stating test data axiom building them). Remember supporting Cause-to-Effect Effect-to-Cause (unlike Rationalist Descartes supports Deduction/Cause-to-Effect, even explicitly criticized Galileo's empirical Induction Effect-to-Cause work, Descartes heartily supports Geometrism narrow sense). So Hobbes says can't Think/Reason without Language Philosophy need precise words' meaning, two points shared Analytical Philosophy (from 5-min research it) makes even eager read books. I wonder Hobbes Analytical Philosophy close. ""In power making Laws, comprehend also power Explaining need"", Montesquieu says otherwise Three Branches Government Theory (USA Congress makes Laws Supreme Court one Explains Interpret Law).","199 reviews

Cybermilitia,"Öncelikle YKY'den çıkan Semih Lim çevirisini ben beğendim. Orijinalinden zaman zaman çarpraz okumayla gidiyorum. Kavram karşılıkları bana oturmuş göründü. Belki bazı fiil karşılıkları günümüz Türkçesinde başka anlamalara gelmeye başladı denebilir. Mesela ""Owneth""'ı ""üstlenmek"" fiiliyle karşılamış ama ""sahibi olmak"" daha uygun geliyor bana. Şu ana kadar gördüğüm en büyük problem, 16. baskı 129'uncu sayfada bir çeviri hatası değil de bir kafa karışıklığı. Semih Lim sf. 126da 62. dip notta Actor'u Fail, Author'u ise Amil olarak karşılayacağını belirtmiş. Oysa Sf. 129'da orijinalde ""An Actor May Be Many Men Made One By Plurality Of Voyces."" ile başlayan paragrafı ""Bir amil, oy çokluğuyla tek yapılmış çok sayıda insan olabilir."" olarak çevirmiş. Burada Actor Fail olduğuna göre cümle ""Bir fail, oy çokluğuyla tek yapılmış çok sayıda insan olabilir."" şeklinde olmalıydı. Amil-Fail/Author-Actor kavram çifti, kitabın ilerisinde sözleşmenin temellerine temas ettiği için -doğrudan onun üzerine de kurabilirdi- çok kritik bir yerde gibi geldi bana. Eğer Türkçesinden okumuşsanız, sizdeki baskılarda da aynı problem var mı? Daha önce okurken aynı yerde kafamın karıştığını ama ileride anlarım diye önemsemediğimi hatırlıyorum. Dolayısıyla 16. baskıya kadar devam etmiş olabilir bu hata. Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı - Sf. 62 - ""Doğal sonradan kazanılmış zeka. Doğal zeka. Bu erdemler iki türlüdür, doğal sonradan kazanılmış. Doğal zeka ile, insanın doğuştan sahip olduğu şeyi kastetmiyorum: çünkü bu algıdan başka bir şey değildir; ve, bu bakımdan insanlar birbirlerinden hayvanlardan pek fazla farklı değildir. Dolayısıyla bu [algı, - Çev.] erdemler arasında sayılmamalıdır. Kastettiğim şey, sadece pratik deneyle, yöntemsiz, eğitimsiz öğretimsiz, elde edilen zekadır. Bu DOĞAL ZEKA esas olarak iki şeyden oluşur; düşünme çabukluğu, yani, bir düşüncenin diğerini hızla izlemesi belirlenen bir amaca doğru kararlı biçimde yöneliş..."" Burada günümüzde kabul edilen zeka formundan farklı bir form düşünüyor Hobbes. Zeka olarak karşılanan kelime ""wit"", kullanımdan kalkmış bir sözcük. Mental kapasite anlamına geliyor. Hemen hemen şöyle bir form düşünebiliriz: Doğuştan zeka (algı) -> Doğal zeka (Naturall) -> Sonradan kazanılmış (Acquired) zeka. Bu bölünme bana ilginç geldi. Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.81 ""Bütün insanlardaki durmak bilmez kudret arzusu"" pasajı. Görünüşte belki Schopenhauer, ama daha çok Nietzsche'nin Güç İstenci'ni önceliyor görünse de, bu istenci basit bir ""ekonomide bulunan mekanizma""ya bağlıyor. Bu sebeple benim dikkatimi bu nokta çekti: ""Bunun nedeni, insanın halen elde ettiğinden daha büyük bir hazza ulaşmayı istemesi; veya ölçülü bir kudretle yetinmemesi değil; iyi yaşamak için halen sahip olduğu kudret imkanları, daha fazlasını elde etmeksizin, güvence altına alamayacağı gerçeğidir."" Yani gözle görünür olan bu durumu, hem Nietzscheci Güç İstenci'nin, hem de Marxist Meta Fetişizmi kavramından çok daha zayıf bir mekanizmayla kolayca açıkladığını düşünmesi. ""Desire Power"" diyerek ""Will Power"" ya da ""Commodity Fetishism""i karşıladığını düşünüyor. Tabi, gerçek örnekleri düşününce, mesela bir taraftan 7 göbek sülalesini kurtarmışların hırsı, diğer taraftan ahir zamanların en büyük patronlarının görünüşte de olsa parayla pek ilgili olmayan ilişkileri burada basit bir kendini garantiye alma mekanizması olmadığını gösteriyor. Bu örneklerin baya baya ""tarih yapıcı"" konumlarını da düşünürsek bu noktada tıkanıyor. Zaten kendi kalıbına uymayan arzuları delilik, kötülük şeklinde istisna ilan ederek kitabın çeşitli noktalarında kötülüyor. Ya da daha evrimsel bir çizgi izleyebileceği İbni Haldun'daki Asabiyet mekanizmasını da hesaba katmadığı/düşünmediği için ortalama, hatta sıkıcı, neredeyse tarih üstü, evrime kapalı, başka iktidar odaklarının rekabeti iktidar sahiplerinin yanlışları dışında değişme ihtimali olmayan bir yönetim mekanizmasına sıkıştırıyor kendi fikirlerini. Hem de Cromwell çağında. ... gibi geldi bana... ""Hem de Cromwell çağında"" demek yerine ""Tam da Cromwell çağı sebebiyle"" demem gerekirmiş... gibi geldi bana... Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.82 Şu sıralar hala popüler bir örnek olması sebebiyle ""Rahatlık isteğinden, ölüm veya yaralanma korkusundan sivil itaat"" pasajında ""Chaos ladder"" tadında bir cümle geçiyor. ""Öte yandan, yoksul zorluk içinde bulunan, durumlarından hoşnutsuz kişiler ve, ayrıca askersel buyurma ihtirası içindeki kişiler ise, savaş nedenlerini devam ettirmeye nifak yaratmaya eğilimlidirler: çünkü askeri onur ancak savaşla kazanılır; kötü bir oyunu düzeltmek için de, kartların yeniden dağıtılmasından başka bir umut yoktur."" Ne yazık ki, burada da toplumsal değişimi açıklayabilecek parlak bir mekanizma Hobbes tarafından harcanıyor. Eğer üzerinde daha fazla düşünmeye başlasa, ya da ileride anlatacağı iktidarı sarsabilecek mekanizmalar içine katılsa hem değişimi hem de yönetselliğin bu değişime karşı neleri düzenlemesi gerektiğine ilişkin güzel bir fikir olabilirdi. O dönem Hobbes'un etkilendiği diğer yazarları ya da zeitgeist'i iyi bilmediğim için bu fikrin ilk onda mı ortaya çıktığını bilemiyorum. Ama ilk çağ filozoflarında olmadığı kesin. Bimeyenler için sahne şu: Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.85 Doğru yanlışın ne olduğunun bilinmemesinden ötürü, geleneğe bağlanmak pasajında, Kant'ın Aydınlanma Nedir? metninden tanıdığımız bir metaforla karşı karşıyayız. ""Hak, hakkaniyet, hukuk adaletin nedenleri kökenlerinin yapısı bilmemek, insanı, gelenek emsali, hareketlerinde kural kabul etmeye yöneltir; öyle ki, cezalandırılmaları gelenek olmuş bir şeyin haksız olduğunu; cezalandırılmaması hatta onaylanması bir örnek oluşturan veya, bu yanlış adalet ölçütünü kullanan hukukçuların saçma sapan adlandırmasıyla, bir emsal teşkil eden şeylerin ise haklı olduğunu düşünürler; tıpkı, ana babalarından efendilerinden aldıkları cezadan başka; iyi kötü davranışlar için genel kural bilmeyen çocuklar gibi; şu farkla ki çocuklar kurallarına bağlıdır, büyükler ise değil..."" Yalnızca ortak metaforu (Çocukluk -> Olgunluk / Aydınlanma öncesi durum -> Aydınlanma) kullanmıyorlar, aynı zamanda Hobbes, Kant'a kadar pişe pişe, olgunlaşarak gelen bir düşüncenin ham halini ortaya atıveriyor. Ayrıştıkları yer bu pasajın sonunda büyükler kurallara bağlı olmadıkları için ortaya çıkan ""işine geldiği gibi anlama"" durumu. Buradan Hobbes, büyüklerin işlerine gelmese geometri kitaplarını bile yaktıracaklarını, dolayısıyla kuralları istedikleri gibi yorumlayabildikleri konusuna geliyor. Kant ise mekanizmanın büyükler için de işlediğini düşünüyor. Yani geleneksel kurallara uyumla aklı çalıştırma arasındaki gerilimi görünüşte Kant'tan daha gerçekçi ele alıyor. Bu nokta çokomelli... Üzerinde düşünmek gerek. Düşündükten sonra edit: Tabi ki daha gerçekçi ele alır. Kant'ınki metafor. Yani bir tür modelleme. Sınırları belli. Hobbes ise doğrudan durumu anlatıyor. Zaten amacı durumdan vazife çıkarmak. Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.103 14'cü, Birinci İkinci Doğa yasaları Sözleşmeler Üzerine bölümünde Özgürlük nedir pasajında ilgimi çeken bir yer var. ""Özgürlük nedir. ÖZGÜRLÜK'ten, kelimenin doğru anlamıyla, dış engellerin yokluğu anlaşılır: bu engeller, çoğu zaman, insanın dilediğini yapma gücünün bir bölümünü elinden alabilirler; fakat, kendisinde kalan gücü, muhakeme aklının emrettiği şekilde kullanmaktan onu alıkoyamazlar."" Burada Kant'ın özgürlük tanımıyla karşılaştırma yaparsak, özgürlüğü sınırlandıran herşeyi ""dış""arda düşündüğünü görürüz. Oysa Kant'ta içsel arzular, istekler de özgürlüğü kısıtlayan, sınırlandıran ketlerdir. Ek olarak cümlenin sonunda Tinin Görüngübilim'inin Stoacılık olarak tasfir ettiği aşamanın izlerini de görmek mümkün. Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.104 Temel doğa yasası: Doğal olarak herkesin herşeye hakkı vardır. İlk Doğa Yasası: ...herkesin, onu elde etme umudu olduğu ölçüde, barışı sağlamak için çalışması gerektiği; onu sağlayamıyorsa, savaşın bütün yardım yararlarını araması kullanması gerektiği ilkesi... Yani ""barışı aramak izlemek"" ""bütün yolları kullanarak kendimizi korumak"". İkinci doğa yasası: ... bir insan, başkaları da aynı şekilde düşündüklerinde[n], barışı kendini korumayı istiyorsa, herşey üzerindeki hakkını bıraklmalı başkalarına karşı, ancak kendisine karşı onlara tanıyacağı kadar özgürlükle yetinmelidir. Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris: Sana yapılmasını istemedğin şeyi sen de başkalarına yapma. Yoruma gerek yok sanırım... :) Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.111-112 ""Korkuyla yapılan ahitler geçerlidir."" fikri ile bir sonraki sayfada ""İşkence ile elde edilen suçlamalar da ifade olarak kabul edilmemelidir"" düşüncesi çelişkili görünüyor. Burada da ahit/sözleşme/söz kavramının Hobbes'taki merkezi önemini görüyoruz. Bir kere ahit yapmışsanız, onun gerekliliğini yerine getirmek zorundasınız. Hristiyanlıkta ahit kavramı, Müslümanlıktan çok daha merkezi önemde olduğundan, yarısından fazlası İncil'in egemenler lehine nasıl yorumlanacağını anlatan bir kitapta bu normal sayılabilir. Eski Ahit - Yeni Ahit anlamındaki Old & New Testament adlandırmasıyla Okunan anlamındaki Kur'an karşılaştırması bunu veriyor zaten. Öykülerin gerçekliğine ilişkin son yıllarda büyük soru işaretleri ortaya çıksa da (Tom Holland - In shadow sword etc.) Medine sözleşmesinin ilgası, Mekke'ye giriş, Hayber kalesinin fethi, heretik Şeytan Ayetleri anlatısı, ilk iç savaş da denen Ali-Muaviye arasındaki ihtilaf, ardından gelen İkinci Fitne de denen ikinci iç savaş vs ele alınınca ahdin defalarca bozulduğunu, bunun son derece sıradan olduğunu görüyoruz. Takiye kavramının merkezi yeri bile bunu gösteriyor. Bu nokta bence Hobbes'un anlatısının en kırılgan yerlerinden biri. Hatta Hobbes'un insanın yaratılıştan kötü olduğu, sebeple denetlenmesi gerektiğini düşündüğü şeklindeki kent efsanesinin parçalandığı yer diyebilirim. Hobbes bariz insanların ahitleri onun anlattığı kadar önemseyeceğini düşünüyor. İnsanı dürüst sanıyor. Yazık... :p Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.114-116 Tam bu ahdin tutulması noktasında Hobbes, neden verilen sözlerin tutulması gerektiğine ilişkin bir pasajla karşımıza çıkıyor. Adalet akla aykırı değil pasajında, adaleti doğrudan ahdin tutulması olarak betimliyor. Buradan yola çıkarak bunun bir doğa yasası olduğunu söylüyor. Niçin verilen sözlerin tutulması gerektiğine ilişkin temel argümanı şu: Dolayısıyla, ahdini bozarak akıllıca bir iş yaptığını söyleyen bir kimse, barış savunma için birleşmiş hiç bir topluma kabul edilemez... Dikkat ederseniz argümanda devlet yok, ruhani otorite yok, ki kitabın son bölümlerinde Papalık tartışmasında bu otoriteyi saymayacak, ruhani otoriteye erk veren Tanrı yok. Yalnızca barış savunma için birleşmiş toplum var. Bu argüman zaten devletsiz toplumlar hayal edenlerin kullandığı ana argümandır. Yani karikatürize edersek, Hobbes Anarşistlerden argüman devşirmiş gibi görünüyor. :) Ayaklanma yoluyla iktidarı ele geçirmek isteyenlere karşı kullanabildiği tek argüman, başkalarının da bunu yapabileceği. Böylece tüm toplumu diğer bireylerle ilişkileri ikincil, atomize bireyler olarak ele alıyor. Ki birey diğerlerini kandırıp iktidarı almak için fırsat kollayan kişiler haline geliyor. Sınıflar yok, ilişkiler ikincil, yani bireyler bir şekliyle büyümüş birey olmuş, artık ahidlerini tutması gereken birimler. Çok fazlasıyla modern hukuk anlatısındaki birey betimlemelerine benziyor. Zamandan, mekandan, evrimden, evrilmeden, eğitimden, aralarındaki farklılıklarından muaf, adeta tarih dışı eşit bireyler. Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.104-123 Hobbes'un doğa yasaları olarak adlandırdığı ilkeleri listelemekte fayda var: 1-Barış kendini koruma 2-Başkalarının da var olduğunu düşünme, onların haklarını da gözetme 3-Adalet 4-Minnettarlık 5-Karşılıklı uyum ya da Nezaket 6-Affetmek 7-Öç alırken yalnızca gelecekteki faydayı düşünmek 8-Aşağılamamak 9-Kibirli olmamak 10-Küstah olmamak 11-Hakkaniyet 12-Ortak şeylerin eşit kullanımı 13-Kura 14-Ekberiyet (Yani doğadaki kura, ilk çocuğa daha büyük haklar verilmesi) 15-Barış için aracılık yapanların güvenlik içinde geçmelerine izin verilmesi 16-Hakem kararına razı olmak 17-Hiç kimse kendisinin yargıcı olamaz. 18-Kendisinde doğal bir taraflılık nedeni olan kişi yargıç olamaz. 19-Ortada başka ezici kanıtlar yoksa üçüncü tarafların tanıklığına güvenmek. ""...kendine yapılmasını istemeyeceğin bir şeyi başkasına yapma"" Bu liste bana On Emir'in inceltilmiş haliyle, modern hukuk teorilerinin ilkelerinin ilkel bir versiyonunun karşımı gibi geldi. Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.133 Kitabın ana önermesi: ""Devletin Amacı, bireysel güvenliktir... Kılıcın zoru olmadıkça ahitler sözlerden ibarettir insanı güvence altına almaya yetmez."" Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.134 ""Tek bir karar verici tarafından yönetilmeyen bir çoğunlukla da sağlanamaz"" bölümü Platon Aristo'dan büyük farklar içeriyor. Burada sağlanamayan, ""bireysel güvenlik""tir. ""Çünkü, güçlerinin en iyi nasıl kullanılacağı uygulanacağı konusunda farklı görüşlere sahip oldukları için, birbirlerine yardım etmek bir yana engel olurlar karşılıklı muhalefetle güçlerini hiç mertebesine indirirler: böylece, sadece, birleşmiş az sayıda insan tarafından kolayca egemenlik altına alınmakla kalmazlar,; aynı zamanda, ortak bir düşman yoksa, bireysel çıkarları için kendi aralarında savaş ederler."" Platon (Devlet / Devlet Adamı) Aristo'daki (Politika) çokluğun kararlarının azlığın kararlarından doğal olarak daha iyi, daha doğru olduğu şeklindeki akıl yürütme düşünülünce bu nokta baya problemli hale geliyor. İki ayrı zaman zaman sentezlenmesi gereken momentler söz konusu aslında. Bu iki momentin sentezi için örneğin bkz. Roma Cumhuriyeti - Parlamento tarafından verilen Diktatörlük kurumu. Yani geçici süreler için, büyük bir probleme karşı çokluk tarafından yetkilendirilmiş birleşmiş kişi iktidarı. MÖ 501'den (Titus Lartius'den) MÖ 44 Sezar'a kadar 457 yıl iç savaşlar da yaratsa da ite kaka idare etmiş, bir sentez. Merhum Roma Cumhuriyet'inin yok oluş nedeni olduğu iddiasını naif bulmak gerek. Lakin unutmamak lazım ki, Hobbes'taki eğilim günümüzdeki popülist diktatörlüklere eğilimin başat nedenidir. Bunu Machivelli'nin Fransız-Türk yönetimleri karşılaştırmasıyla birlikte ele almak lazım. O da bir sentez sonuçta. Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.136 Kitabın adını da veren ana pasaj bu sayfada yer alıyor. Burada çevirmen ilginç bir şey yapmış. Leviathan'ı Ejderha diye çevirmiş. Oysa Leviathan özel bir isim, üstelik kitabın adı. [Yani herkes ortak barış güvenlik için ahite evet dediğinde] ""Bu yapıldığında tek bir kişilik halinde birleşmiş olan topluluk, bir DEVLET, Latince CIVITAS, olarak adlandırılır. İşte EJDERHA'nın veya, daha saygılı konuşursak, ölümsüz tanrının altında, barış savunmamızı borçlu olduğumuz, ölümlü tanrının doğuşu böyle olur."" Bu noktadan sonrasında Goodreads'in sınırları geldik.","102 reviews

Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan revolves around idea leading expounding upon surprising amount insight political religious thought. Hobbes’ work divided four parts first, “Of Man”, covering human nature men form governments greater good postulate protect stuff. Hobbes essentially says men give freedom government protected men keep life possessions add to. In second part, “Of Commonwealth”, Hobbes argues perfect government one absolute sovereign—whether monarch legislative body—that control aspects government aim preserve persons governed means necessary govern must obey sovereign aspects life including religion taxation, later must used support unable maintain themselves. In part three, “Of Christian Commonwealth”, Hobbes discusses Christian commonwealth governed essentially says civil power final arbiter spiritual revelation thus religious power subordinate sovereign seen Holy Scriptures. In final part, “Of Kingdom Darkness”, Hobbes turns focus towards ignorance true light knowledge causes stem religious deceivers four things—misinterpretation, demonology saints, mixing religion erroneous Greek philosophy, mixing false doctrines traditions feigned history. Hobbes blames churches churchmen causes beneficiaries expense civil power endangers commonwealth preservation every man them. As one earliest influential works social contract theory, Hobbes’ political ideas often cited quoted. However, fact almost half work religious discourse surprise insightful. That Hobbes discredited church-led states gratifying, though recommended state control religion disappointment surprising given theme work.

Hobbes opinion that, mind, since Kingdom God yet come, bound laws (divinely appointed?) sovereign, using extensively drawn view Moses first ‘civil sovereign.’ Even Sovereign unjust, forces one renounce God, doesn’t really matter (AND Sovereign, sovereign, NEVER unjust), Hobbes points time time again, slaves obedient masters subjects sovereign. God sort end, He see hearts men. Hobbes despises ecclesiastical power, particular, Roman Catholic Church. Given time period way church exerted power time, I hardly blame him. Ironically, causes argue favor idea absolute power Sovereign separation Church State power, seen abuse Church’s power firsthand (and unsurprisingly branded heretic).

My interest lay relationship drafting United States constitution work Thomas Hobbes. I certainly see many direct sources inspiration first half book.

Max,"خلاصة كتبتها لأصدقائي على الفيسبوك, أي فهي ليست مراجعة أو ريفيو بمعنى الكلمة اللفايثان هو اسم كتاب لـ الفيلسوف الانجليزي توماس هوبز وضع فيه أساسيات نظرية ""العقد الإجتماعي"" في مفهومها الحديث. يعد من أمهات الكتب في السياسة وبالغ الأهمية خصوصا أن هوبز كتبه بعد ""الحرب الأهلية الإنجليزية"" كوسيلة لتجنب تكرار مثل هذه الحرب. بداية الكتاب ابيستيمولوجية (الفرع المتخصص بالمعرفة في الفلسفة), أي يحاول الإجابة عن أسئلة مثل ما هي المعرفة أو الأفكار؟ ما مدى معرفتنا بشيء معين والحس والإدراك. وجدير بالذكر أن هوبز التقى بـ ""جاليليو جاليلي"" في إحدى رحلاته فأخذ عنه منهجه العلمي, فالكتاب متسم بسلسلة مترابطة من الإفتراضات وإستنت��جاتها المنطقية. حيث أنه يعتقد بأن علم الهندسة ومسلماته يجدر بأن يكون لغة فلسفية بذاتها, لأن الهندسة تجد ثباتها في مصطلحاتها المتفق عليها من الجميع, وبالتالي فإن البراهين والحجج المستنتجة غير قابلة للدحض. ومن هنا كان يرى أنه يجب أن نجد أرضية مشتركة ولكن هل صعب أو ""مستحيل"" المنال. لماذا؟ الجواب يأتي من هوبز, فهو يعتقد أن الطبيعة التي نلاحظها واحدة, ولكن بسبب الفروقات الجسدية والذهنية والعقائد والمفاهيم فإن كل منا يراها بزاوية مختلفة. بمعنى آخر, إختلاف التجربة يؤدي إلى إختلاف المعنى, وبالتالي لا يمكن الوصول إلى يقين. ما الذي يرميه إليه هوبز؟ إنه يقول بأن الحقيقة لا يمكن أن تكون من الطبيعة, لأنها إعتباطية وتختلف من شخص إلى آخر وتؤدي إلى جدل. إذا الحقائق يجب أن تستمد من المجتمع. فهي حقائق لأن الجميع وافقوا عليها, فهي الخيار الوحيد. أيظا إستعماله للهندسة والمنطق وتأييده للعلم كل ذلك لأنه يريد الحقائق والمسلمات أن تفض جميع انواع النزاع والجدال التي قد تؤدي إلى ""حرب أهلية"" على سبيل المثال. يرى هوبز ان طبيعة الإنسان هي السعي الدائم وراء السلطة وأن هذا لا يوقفه الا الموت. أو الخوف من الموت أو الأذى فقط ما يدفعهم نحو الجنح إلى السلم. والأخلاق ما هي إلا المفاوضات التي تأتي ما بين السلطة والخوف لتحقيق السلام. من الكلام السابق, توجه هوبز إلى التحدث عن الإنسان (ما قبل المجتمع) أو ما يعرف لدى البعض بـ (الحالة الطبيعية), ورغم أن الأمر إفتراضي فقط, ولكنه قال أن الإنسان عاش في زمن لم تكن فيه سلطة متعارف عليها لتضعه عند حده, فأدى ذلك إلى جنوح كل إنسان, ضد كل إنسان آخر, وهكذا انعدمت الثقافة والملاحة والمعرفة والمعمار والفنون والحروف والمجتمع ككل. والأسوء من كل هذا هو استمرار الخوف وتواصل الخطر من الموت العنيف. وحياة الإنسان سوف تكون وحيدة وضعيفة ومقرفة وبهيمية وقصيرة. الخلاص يكمن في عاطفتين عند الإنسان وهما ""الخوف"" و ""المنطق"". الخوف يجعل الإنسان يحاول الفرار من هذه الحالة الطبيعية البهيمية. والمنطق يظهر للإنسان الكيفية التي تجعله ينجح في ذلك. اول نتيجة يستنتجها الإنسان هي, ما أطلق عليها هوبز مصطلح, ""قانون الطبيعة"", وهي قاعدة عامة أي أنها بعكس (القانون المدني) يمكن لأي إنسان الوصول لها بالمنطق والفلسفة. وأول قوانينها هو أن الإنسان يجب أن يسعى للسلام بقدر الإمكان, وإن لم يستطع فإنه يجب أن يستخدم كل السبل وبما فيها الحرب لكي يصنع هذا السلام. القانون الثاني ينص على أننا لكي نعيش بآمان وتحضر يجب أن تسلب منا بعض حقوقنا الطبيعية, مثل أن تقتل شخص آخر, عندما تسلب حقك هذا فإن الآخرين يسلبون حقوقهم في قتلك. ومن ثم يقوم هوبز بإستنتاج قوانين آخرى مماثلة تعتمد كل واحدة على القانون الذي يسبقها وهناك حق واحد لا يمكن التنازل عليه وهو حقك في البقاء أو الحفاظ على الذات. ولكن على الرغم من ان قانون الطبيعة يسعى للسلام الا أن الطمع الإنساني للسلطة سيجعله يخرق هذا القانون مرارا ومرارا, لذلك كان يجب وضع سلطة عامة وذات سيادة وهي التي ستجبر الناس على الإلتزام بالعقد الإجتماعي أو القانون. ولكي تكون هذه السلطة ذات مفعول فيجب أن تكون إرادتها مبنية على إرادة الجميع وبذلك تكون هيئة خيالية, أطلق عليها هوبز إسم ""اللفايثان"" وهو إسم وحش بحري مذكور في ""العهد القديم"". أيظا صورة الغلاف هي تجسيد لهذه الشخصية الخيالية ""اللفايثان"". ويعطى ""اللفايثان"" السلطة المطلقة تجعله يفعل أي شيء يراه ضروري لحماية الأمة أو (الناس). جميع حقوق الأفراد أعيرت للفايثان, إلا حق واحد وهو حق الحفاظ على الذات أو الحياة لأنه السبب الأصلي لتأسيس العقد الإجتماعي. رغم توفر ثلاثة خيارات, إما ملكية, أو أرسطوقراطية, أو ديمقراطية. إلا أن هوبز يفضل الملكية. لأن الملك في رأيه يمثل التجسيد الأقرب للفايثان كشكل السلطة ولأنه العقل الوحيد فإن قراراته ستكون أسرع وحاسمة, وأيظا إستبعاد نشوب حرب أهلية لأن الملك لا يمكن أن يختلف أو يعارض نفسه.","191 reviews

Simon King,"When I read book, I felt orbited around three categories: 1) painfully tedious, 2) fascinating 3) scary. Hobbes fastidiously clear. Because argument human nature, spends around 100 pages defining humans feel, sense think. That part tedious. Also, last sections book, describes lawmaking, Christianity ecclesiastical power, also tedious. I find main crux argument fascinating, though. Without laws, without social contract gives us equal rights, society degenerates perpetual state war, natural state mankind. I find bits fascinating. However, dotted around there, find really scary shit. The leader, 'the sovereign,' everyone else special constitutional powers. All subjects must pliantly worship him. He essentially different Putin, Trump Chavez even Hitler, Mussolini Franco. Such leader guarantee law order. The 'sovereign' Hobbes' commonwealth appears prefigure autocrats. Reading book bit slog - took four months. Whilst I find central ideas fascinating, reading times bit exasperating. Maybe I read abridged version.","13 reviews

Anastasia Bodrug,"După jumătate de an, în sfârșit pot spune că terminat lectura Leviatanului! URA! O lucrare foarte dificilă ��i cam plictisitoare pentru mine, sincer să spun. Nu mii rușine să recunosc că așa carte ""intelectuală"" nu mi-a plăcut. Pur și simplu eu cred că nu încă acele capacități mentale ca să pot primi plăcere din astfel de lectură. Unele dintre capitole mi-au fost interesante, dar majoritatea mi-au fost greu de citit, în special ultima dintre cărțile despre statul creștin (din simplul motiv că religia absolut defel nu mă interesează). Ceea ce vreau să observ este că aceasta este un fel de explicație lucrurilor evidente, după care începi să înțelegi domeniul juridic un pic altfel. Ei bine, opinia lui Hobbes în ceea ce privește monarhia și suveranul echitabil este puțin utopică, dar dreptul la existență.","164 reviews

Renny Doig,"Very appropriately named. The old language disagreeable conclusions make book difficult get through, interesting book read. It's clear book important work. He presents series arguments necessary form government proceed less logically principles human nature. I believe conclusions incorrect due faulty first principles, sloppy argumentation. Hobbes' constructs Commonwealth throughout four parts book. The first part, ""Of Man"", consists description people essentially entirely selfish whose fundamental driving force preservation acquisition power. I think views unrealistically pessimistic, starting point easy see advocated authoritative government. In second part, ""Of Commonwealth"", builds definition ""of man"" construct form government necessary preserve subjects aggressive human nature. The last two parts entirely focused interpreting Christian scripture establish structure limits authority Church within commonwealth. I found two parts felt like could separate treatise bit slog get through. Overall I found book interesting historical significance ideas contained.

Aaron,"Buch 1 hatte den wissenschaftlichen Ansatz, den Mensch präzise zu beschreiben, welcher auch teilweise gelingt. Jedoch ist es philosophisch betrachtet nicht wirklich spannend und interessant (=kontrovers höhö) (2/5). Buch 2 hingegen ist ziemlich cool und beinhaltet ziemlich das wichtigste Kapitel im Werk (Kap. 13) und setzt auch einen gewissen Wendepunkt der Politischen Philosophie. Kontraste zu Aristoteles werden hier ebenfalls gesetzt, auch wenn sie Buch 3 deutlicher werden. Meiner Meinung nach kann man auch mit Buch 2 starten bzw. Kapitel 13 lesen und dann schauen ob man sich für weiteres von Hobbes/Leviathan interessiert (4/5). Buch 3 knüpft den zweiten Teil und stellt viele These auf, die heutzutage ziemlich kontrovers wären, wenn man sie auf offener Straße einfach rausschreien würde. ! Lebt Angst und Schrecken oder ergebt euch vor Olaf Scholz als alleinigen Herrscher über uns. Möge der Leviathan uns richten ! Philosophisch betrachtet ist dies natürlich interessant und die systematische Herangehensweise von Hobbes ist eigentlich nachvollziehbar. Auch Erkenntnisse auf die Hobbes schließt sind alles andere als aus der Luft gegriffen und dämlich. Ziemlich erschreckend. Teilweise wird es mir persönlich zu politisch bei der Erklärung und Bedeutung jeder staatlichen Position und deren Beziehungen (auch wenn es beim ""Bürger"" und Monarchen sinnvoll und noch besten ist) (3,5). Buch 4 habe ich meinem Seminar nicht wirklich behandelt und deshalb nur teilweise gelesen...Es klingt zumindest nicht unspannend, aber Eindrücke und Bewertungen sind nicht vorhanden. Eigentlich nicht wirklich extrem relevant, aber die Frage ob Hobbes nun religiös war oder nicht bleibt unbeantwortet oder zumindest ist dies nicht eindeutig wie bei Descartes oder Locke. Dies finde ich irgendwie ganz spannend und lässt einen grübeln. Insgesamt ein gelungenes Werk, auch wenn es nicht immer interessant bleibt und man dann teilweise doch zu sehr die Hand geführt wird (das ich durch die Nase keine Farben rieche, sondern natürlich essen schmecke, weiß ich Hobbes!!! Danke, dass brauchst du mir nicht erklären). Okay schlechter joke hinter mir zur Aufmunterung, nach dem mich der willkürliche Monarch angegriffen hat. Insgesamt wahrscheinlich eher 3,5 von 5, aber aufgrund der herausstechenden Kapitel, die ich hier relativ hoch bewerte und extrem im Kopf bleiben, verdient es dann doch eher eine 4/5.

Anderson Paz,"A obra Leviatã de Hobbes foi publicada em 1651 e se tornou um clássico pensamento político. A obra, entretanto, trata mais que sobre teoria Estado. Hobbes se propõe discutir sobre matéria, forma e poder de um Estado tanto civil quanto eclesiástico. O Leviatã de Hobbes quer cajado eclesiástico e cetro príncipe. Leviatã, para Hobbes, é um Estado artificial ou um Homem artificial que funciona para proteger e defender sua própria existência, como também liberdade individual. O livro tem quatro partes: Na primeira, Hobbes trata homem. Hobbes apresenta seu empirismo britânico discutindo sobre como homem forma pensamentos, imaginação, linguagem, racionalidade, paixões, conhecimento. Ele também discute sobre virtudes intelectuais, objetos conhecimento, poder, honra, comportamentos, religião. No fim da primeira parte, Hobbes finalmente apresenta seus conhecidos conceitos de estado da natureza vs. estado de guerra, contrato social, relação entre justiça e leis naturais e papel Estado em garantir liberdade individual naquilo que não proibir. Na segunda parte, Hobbes trata Estado. Ele discute sobre surgimento poder soberano Estado, os direitos Soberano, formas de governo e sucessão, formas de conquista, liberdade negativa, partes Estado, papel dos ministros, domínio soberano sobre terras, relação entre leis naturais e positivas, crime, penas, recompensas, doutrinas que ameaçam Estado, competências poder soberano. Na terceira parte, Hobbes trata Estado Cristão. Aqui Hobbes apresenta uma teologia política em que Estado tem importante papel na interpretação bíblica. Para ele, reino de Deus é reino civil. Ele então trata de anjos, inspiração bíblica, profetas, milagres, igreja, direitos reinado de Deus, papel de Jesus. Hobbes entende que soberano deve governar sobre igreja e Estado e homem deve obedecer soberano para agradar Deus. Por fim, Hobbes trata ""reino das trevas"" em que discute sobre potenciais ameaças religiosas à soberania Estado. Ele trata de erros de interpretação bíblica, demônios e elementos pagãos na prática cristã, vãs tradições e filosofias e faz duras críticas ao papado romano. Esse livro é muito mais que uma teoria política. O empirismo de Hobbes leva defender um Estado autocrata para assegurar tanto estabilidade de um país quanto liberdade individual. E, para Hobbes, isso só era possível submetendo igreja e Estado ao Soberano. Esse é um contrato ""liberal"" um tanto esquisito para quem está século XXI.","Author

This also absolute virtues (being also Hobbesian laws nature) peace life (self-preservation degree totally risk-averse) Hobbesian bourgeoisie predominant Western society today, majority (possibly) Westerners close impossible understand thumos (spiritedness) still prevalence within cultures (and public discourse often described ""barbarian"".) - While Hobbes may scathingly critical contemporary Christian ""loftiness"" (not least regards papacy Catholicism), endeavors restrict philosophical inquiry natural world, sovereign power sets forth nevertheless biblically based (in regard Hobbes referring strictly kingship). It certainly discussed whether aim somehow reconcile science religion, simply adapt latter former avoiding accusations heresy atheism. - Though however materialist Hobbes's scriptural interpretation may be, four parts book divided into, third, ""Christian Commonwealth"" far longest them, though also rails ideas like ""incorporeal substance"" ""immortality soul"", includes highly original version Trinity - intriguingly heterodox blend words. - But perhaps accurate say view religion (in statecraft) , meaning religion realm life sovereign deal decisively. This means sovereign (and certainly anyone clergy) must authoritative head church.(See also Hobbes's mature view issues.)

(Hobbes discusses reason length chapter V, defining ""nothing reckoning (that is, adding subtracting) consequences general names agreed upon"" ... ""not reason always right reason, well arithmetic certain infallible art.."") Hobbes's fundamental law nature leads second law nature: (XIV)- Hobbes's justification war self-preservation (preservation state vis à vis states) based contract (covenant) sovereign individual citizens entered, wherein obedience (on part citizen) willingly bartered peace safety, sovereign upholder guarantor. And Hobbesian citizens willingly obey alternative natural state (in must Hobbes' famous statement) (XIII) Leviathan (king proud) fix that, more: natural fix; men decide sovereign willingly obey also (Hobbesian) natural law; Hobbes sees natural law calls ""dictates reason"" thing. Hobbes realist; natural goodness man, firstly state nature doesn’t allow that, also definitions ""good"" ""bad"" vary individual basis, according likes dislikes,and prerogative duty sovereign define ""good"" ""bad"", problem different opinions solved transferring power area sovereign. Hobbes sees every citizen nevertheless keep opinions, keeping ""in heart"", outwardly obeying dictates sovereign, (natural) anarchy opinion restricted regulated contract entered into.

F.,"Hobbes, matematik nasıl tanımlarla inşa ediliyor bunun üstüne kurulup doğruluğunu buna dayandırıyorsa herhangi bir kitabın da doğruluğa ulaşması için tanımlarla başlaması gerektiğini söylüyor tanımlarına başlıyor. Rönesans ile Aydınlanma Çağı arasındaki döneme yaşamı denk gelen Hobbes, ilk kez 1651’de yayınlanan eserinde bireysellikten klasik ulus-devlet anlayışına dönerken bunun güvencesi olarak da güvenlik ihtiyacının garantisini ortaya koymakta, bunu yaparken de yönetim olgusunu laikleştirmektedir. Ayrıca, devlet kendisi için değil, yarar fonksiyonu için vardır. “Hak, hakkaniyet, hukuk adaletin nedenleri kökendeki yapısını bilmemek, insanı gelenek emsali, hareketlerinde kural kabul etmeye yöneltir.” der, geniş perspektifte bakıldığında dünyadaki birçok topluluktaki uygulamalar, ülkemizdekiler de dahil, bunu doğrulamaktadır. Egemen gücün kimde olacağı sorusuna ise egemen güç ya bir kişide ya birden fazla kişide ya da herkesten birde olmak zorundadır diyerek monarşi, oligarşi demokrasiye el sallar. Hristiyan Bir Devlet Üzerine kısmından itibaren İncil, Tevrat Zebur’dan alıntılar ile iktidarın gücünün kaynağını dayanaklarını irdeliyor. Son bölüm olan Karanlığın Krallığı Üzerinde ise çoğunlukla bahsi geçen kitaplarda olmayıp, yani dini özü bulunmayıp, da yine de yapılan keyfi uygulamaları kaynaklarıyla eleştiriyor bu yapılan işlemlerin hep iktidarı güvence altına almak amacıyla gerçekleştirildiğini ekliyor. Son iki bölümün okuması, ilgili kitaplar hakkında bilgim fikrim olmadığı için çok zordu.","451 reviews

Charlie,"Carl Schmitt, disciple Thomas Hobbes, famously declared political theorists divided think man naturally good, think naturally evil. I sometimes think another binary would apt - one classed thinkers hope fear. Few sane men ever looked around time thought, 'Yeah, fine.' Misery bites human heel every step. Once upon time teeth buried deep bones seemed like world would never change, thing hope better life next (presumably better) one. Gradually, human leviathan stepped forwards, mad dog still biting ankles keep moving, feverish vision transitioned hope better future world instead. This transition often referred 'The Enlightenment', though that's loaded term one ever agree really meant, happened, stood for. The important thing world never Black Death, Protestantism, Chinese invented gunpowder printing press, maybe first Peasant's Revolt made underclasses wonder kings kept killing making peaceful protests. Regardless, nebulously defined window 14th 17th centuries something wild happened European culture. Long Industrial Revolution turned Britain economic powerhouse, transformation bubbling beneath skin. Well, lot transformations actually. Religious heresies, economic restructurings, development scientific methodologies 'discovery' whole new worlds fundamentally Christian/Islamic hegemonies late Medieval worldview. This Early Modern World. To survey events, characters, art, philosophies draw kind teleology - certain kind Left-Winger - one greatest pleasures history, history viewed one eye only. Men women living time see rise democracy, development capitalism, wonderful powers science industry. They saw little religious consensus ancestors lived cracking neighbours took heresies like infectious, rotting mutation. They saw invincible powers kings queens crumble fall, heard sordid details new kinds theatrical dramatisations printed news-ballads. They saw physicians grabbing bodies dead desecrate them, appealed magic escape misery, burned alive witches. This terrible world. Well, worlds terrible. Suffering pervasive, point perspective. A certain kind thinker (let's call 'Whig') look horror period think ""Dear god, awful. We try change things improve situation,"" they'll consider changes recent past evidence successfully approach work. These people thank universal literacy, vote, NHS, invention fire, also Great Leap Forward, The Holocaust, millionaire celebrities singing 'Imagine' paupers. Some men's hopes deserve come true. The kind thinker looks misery, thinks themselves, ""Holy Christ, awful... could lot worse."" They look past, listen cacophonous howl history, ponder blood-drenched labour required get culture current point, evidence change , or, least needs handled slowly, lest delicate edifice laughably called 'civilization' come like house matches. We men women thank absolutely nothing. Their achievements non-existent, stop clock ticking, feel proud fear sit comfortably atop rotting edifice time. The Early Modern world one continual, evolving, multi-headed crises. The old ideologies failing. Elites needed adapt survive. The poor hungry, sure, middle classes worry about. They ones could afford files sharpen teeth. As kingdoms rocked national uprisings, civil wars, sectarian violence good old fashioned economic squalls, governments needed find new way legitimising rule. There many fine heroic thinkers emerge time, least John Milton, looked ancient Biblical Roman history, fused found contemporary ideas power, faith, knowledge. These characters drew Social Contract theories built Republican notions liberty tyrannicide - along whole host religious financial considerations boring describe - resulted British (or, accurately, British gentry) waging two separate civil wars cutting king's head. It's remarkable British nationalists embarrassed celebrate genuinely magnificent moment history... Regardless, heroism one-sided. This miserable period live (though, rigorous pessimist, I must also reiterate periods terrible live through, though definitely terrible others). Brother brother. Father son. Cromwell genocidal prick. You know clichés. And so, stepping storm like angry prophet, long lock's dripping gore close friends, sharp eye full scorn, high brow full dark rage, come Thomas Hobbes. Thomas Hobbes giant. He titan political science. Indeed, probably first person ever political scientist, imagining kind Newton discovering mathematical laws power rhetoric imitative Euclidean logic. Where power could understood practice rhetoric process artistic mastery subject referred ""Maker's knowledge"", Hobbes tried master political theory abstracting everything human it. Starting famous declaration life mere ""motion limbs"" suggests senses ""pressed"" upon external world, even microscopic level world constant struggle bustling atoms violently exerting power neighbours. When even tenderest touch, loving glance, cast terms, surprise worldview grows one perpetual war, man man, inevitably striving struggling, suffering, afraid? But summaries man justice. His wit solid iron. A true genius, yes. A rhetorician stunning ingenuity literary power, yes. But know what? Thomas Hobbes also greatest scaredy-cat ever lived. He saw maelstrom never wanted world endure anything like again. So terrified chaos willing sell everyone's freedom single monarch would keep things civil, literally wrote book autocracy. 'Nasty, brutish, short' - yeah, yeah, everyone knows Hobbes' pessimism. Everyone knows authoritarian too. It's fashionable call father Totalitarianism - well, considering Schmitt's admiration man - probably true, also accurate consider father Liberalism, perhaps John Locke. At least he's . After all, despite charlatans keen claim, Capitalists repeatedly shown perfectly happy dictators long keep plebs order. At heart, that's Hobbes' monarch really is. A consciously false symbol arbitrarily imposed population keep line rich boys slurp spoils. Yet what's curious Hobbes first theorist Powerful I've read seems genuinely wanting make world better. Power always legion sycophants call on, either rebut criticism abroad salve consciences face blatant facts. Apologists come many forms. Some fools repeating people's words, , whilst others . One never feels need take motives seriously either care want make quick buck establishment, else expect privileged system they're advocating, defences make hierarchy produced bad faith anyway. These men care society outside they'll say whatever takes feel slug-trail stroke power patting back necks. Hobbes... much. This man managed piss . Let's get way. Hobbes modern thinker. Not even Early Modern. . His style thinking accessible us today peers, nothing else shows clearly onto something, even nothing pleasant. His materialism would make Nietzsche blush. His relentless amoralism would make Machiavelli cough fidget stateroom. And atheism... Well, that's question, it? Does Hobbes believe God? The entire second half book rather tedious - though definitely heterodox - slog dutiful biblical commentary, quoting chapter verse prove religion cannot justify sedition, there's something abundance words feels like Hobbes protesting smugly. After much sacrilege cynicism start, staples extra book's worth chapters saying 'Look, I've close-read Bible too!' even grumbles silly university traditions, unjustifiable faith prophets, much absolutely Catholic church ideological stranglehold not-yet-secular states. Then again, makes sense Hobbes try develop religious orthodoxy best serve state interests, whether believes God, course he'd try dictate everyone else taught believe - believe public... Which brings us main point. Hobbes materialist steroids. He refuses even imagine spirits ghosts unless physical dimensions, merely point principle everything fit overarching metaphor 'geometry'. Everything must fit scheme he'll damned even imaginary spirits believe get wriggle frameworks. This emerges work stubborn refusal treat people's rhetoric seriously. When Hobbes talks 'liberty', talk freedom thought - indeed, actually give damn people privately believe long behave public - literally means physical ability move. To Hobbes, 'liberty' river flowing banks stone falling ground unsupported human walking along street job thing, consciously refuses acknowledge anyone abstracts word anything meaningful. If literally chains, free. Now shut get work. Like I said: Father Liberalism. And Hobbes attacks rhetoric obscuring rationality. He attacks study classics filling people's heads silly notions 'liberty' 'tyrannicide' (indeed, seems blame Civil War people read much Epic Poetry... considering frequently English revolutionaries used reference ), though nice ban them, instead asking come footnotes explaining cool ancient heroes actually bad men. Private conscience done away - social contract made, decisions reside Sovereign, preferably single person, disagree law that's tough since ""the law public conscience [you] hath already undertaken guided."" After all, people start thinking themselves, means they're obeying sovereign agree him, different ruled all. Oh god, anarchy! Stop, stop! It's Civil War again! This Hobbes silly, yet also important. Power subject. Power fears, desires understand, so, paradoxically, becomes worships. He could still hear cannons firing wrote words - Paris, yes, justified revolutions tendency spread - desperate urgency every step argument. Every barked command, every ornate metaphor, every bitter condemnation free-thinking radicalism sedition scribbled hand still trembling artillery landing closer closer window. Christ man afraid, I think wrong read awareness traumatic civil war was. There must days seemed like strife would never end, constant bloodshed would world would ever know. In climate, course Hobbes would identify thought experiment men giving freedoms end metaphorical war all-against-all - anything, anything, stop screaming, It desperation leads Hobbes' interesting argument, one I've seen people pay much attention to, despite key appeal. Hobbes' materialism encompassing - time ideals, barely time justice, peace. In light, thinkers powerful desperately try prove such-and-such ruler just, divinely appointed, Hobbes care. His social contract little arbitrary social arrangement put place stop us killing other. At one point even compares ""the laws Commonwealth"" ""the laws gaming: whatsoever gamesters agree injustice none them."" But know, game built arbitrary rules agree follow give structure entertainment. Hobbes takes logic applies . To him, survival rests arbitrary set social arrangements stick even protesting might bring us back chaos again, even harshest autocracy (to mind) better that. Stop complaining, still hear cannons. It one classic, compelling arguments, radicalism society instituted violence fundamentally illegitimate. If bunch Norman nobles came England, massacred English divided property amongst themselves, can't people later massacre descendants inherited ancient blood-money take back? 'Might right' goes ways. Hobbes stares argument head even blink. It matter got here. Keep head down, play game, know place. It could always get worse. Now despite everything, I want harsh Hobbes. This book brutal masterpiece, I space go read, even Hobbes obviously wrong. His arguments ingenious, perspective disarmingly modern forward-looking, rhetoric . Only Milton comes close power, Milton never passage took piss clergy proving they're like international fairy kingdom kidnapping intelligent children replace highly educated parasitical dullards. Yeah, Hobbes funny. I'm surprised are. I went book expecting hate man. His reputation fierce. His influence vast. Everything stands everything I despise. And yet... even pen bleeds truly evil shit onto page (see callous attitude witch burnings want feel blood run cold), I cannot help pitying man. Watch cower corner, flinching every time grapeshot cracks. Watch return revolutionary government hates simply they'll let publish philosophy masters refuse accept, fervently believe importance! What mind! What talent! You stayed away translating Thucydides, poor soul. If reading classics blame choices century, ancient chronicler robbed us wonderful man.

The sovereign's empowered help avoid utter chaos. All bound sovereign sovereign expression will. And double-negative version Golden Rule- unto others don’t want done you. The values men state nature given inherent truths. Hobbes lists brief statement debate. For example, “Riches honorable, power.

The remaining books elaborate upon arguments presented beginning: • ""Of Common-wealth"" discusses rights sovereigns subjects goes legislative mechanics commonwealth. • ""Of Christian Common-wealth"" discusses compatibility Christian doctrine Hobbes' idea Leviathan. • ""Of Kingdom Darkness"" discusses false religious beliefs argues political implementation Leviathan needed achieve secure Christian commonwealth. Hobbes starts considering motions matter, arguing every aspect human nature deduced materialist principles. He depicts natural condition mankind inherently violent, awash fear. He claims state nature ""war every man every man,"" people constantly seek destroy one another. This state horrible human beings seek peace, best way achieve peace construct Leviathan, commonwealth head sovereign ruling head, social contract. I see Hobbes' influence Locke Hume. And I admire methodical way wrote, opinion extreme view feel mankind condemned incurable violence Hobbes put Leviathan, ""war all."" And I disagree famous, oft-quoted statement ""men's lives solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, short."" I believe Hobbes' analysis human nature, like everyone else's, reflection views himself. While I would never underestimate power fear, world leaders history used greatly advantage, much said human dignity empathy. There much said love compassion. And like Nietzsche, Hobbes also goes way speak atheistic attitude, seeming give credence thing seem want believe in. One vehemently oppose idea, idea exist. Fighting idea gives idea power.

Bethany Muczynska,"This one depressing scary books I read thus far. Mind you, I chronologically going Great Books Western thought, get worse... But right Medievals Renaissance literature art, pretty dark. Hobbes' worldview completely mine. His anthropology, soteriology, theology, philosophy, etc another school mine. I could address many things I find wrong worldview. I touch two: justice Catholicism. JUSTICE: Hobbes defines justice something defined sovereign. It appears something subjective, precise, although natural law exists, sovereign ought follow it, thing unjust law. But something cannot unjust, just? Is defining justice existence? His attempts cling solution sovereign brokenness mankind given birth conundrum. If object ruler, easily fall back state war (or ""warre"" old spellings, I loved). But much possible one ruling take advantage subjects? Oh wait, I gave rights sovereign came (rights basically unlimited apparently), anyways thing justice without sovereign. So odd. I liked Plato's definition better. And Wojtyla's personalistic norm. CATHOLICISM: Reading Hobbes's view catholicism Church amusing, little pokes Catholic practices ideas, many misunderstandings them. I particularly enjoyed countered Bellarmine. He would paraphrase B's argument give rebuttal, typical consisted ""but match part already explained worldview obviously wrong."" I left interested reading Bellarmine's arguments papal authority, almost forgetting Hobbes's agenda. Hobbes's rebuttal Matthew 16:18 classic protestant answer usually given. His scriptural scholarship well done. Some authors I think ought meet: John Paul II (for new anthropology soteriology), John Bergsma (for improving exegesis skills), Aristotle (he give man chance threw towards end work).","18 reviews

He's enter—what delectable irony!"" ------------------------------------------ indeed gargantuan monster, perhaps terms page count, definitely terms design content. Hobbes begins grassroots patiently erects formidable edifice directly common green, casting tenfold shadow upon crouching humanity below. The view terra firma pretty: structure heeds man spite artificial construction, must needs provide shelter adjacent villagers, means intends bring welfare happiness. This building Hobbes' Soveraigne: absolute power (either general vote foreign conquest), brooks sedition, pose God's representative will, qualms instituting censorship waging war, freely choose successor, cannot voted office - simply holds effective carte blanche. It instituted sole reason ensuring peace among werewolfdom means necessary. This institution based social contract people draw desperate bid limit others' natural rights (to anything stay alive), enact laws long contradict Hobbes termed Naturall Law, first broken various sections ultimately summed familiar Golden Rule. While exactly clear eminent Soveraigne could compared others way employing Golden Rule, one thing made clear: since people endowed Soveraigne Its power, It cannot cause commonwealth (Its kingdom) state nature disguise. Living 17th century, Hobbes obviously take Christianity account, and, even obviously, reconcile Soveraigne's well-nigh absolute power eternal might God - lesser extent, Pope. He walking reader meticulously thousands Biblical quotes wherewith attempted prove, materialistic lenses, God indeed Almighty, interfere matters commonwealth (indeed, sublunary life compared joyous hereafter!). The Pope, hand, could hop it. This essence message . But flowery somewhat flippant style justice sheer scope ingenuity Hobbes' philosophical prowess. Contrary ""the Schoolemen"" scholastics fans Aristotle held sway universities back day, Hobbes extremely matter-of-fact made point defining effectively terms going build monstrous arguments on. His definitions clear short, train thought steady lucid, thoroughness accursedly impressive. He simply men wolves unto wave Union Jack declaring yet another philosopher king; goes laying concepts like ""will"", ""good"", ""honour"" ""money"" mean, slowly builds enumerate different rights Soveraigne has, Its ideal form (Monarchy), Its relation Its various subjects like ministers, traders clergymen etc. In two final chapters, comprise half book, puts forth credible interpretation Scriptures, taking consistent stance things read parables. It's wonder accused atheism back day (though I personally believe anyone well-versed reverent towards Bible could considered heretic): hints God material, circular logic Bible's authority proclaimed within book absolute fact lived with, insists Satan never left untranslated hinted personality simply random enemy, finds evidence everlasting death, negates special rights interpreted invested Apostles, differentiates Kingdom God (on Earth) Kingdom Christ (in heaven), refutes idea eternal afterlife heaven (it rather Kingdom God) asserts Soveraigne's considered prophets, international ecclesiastical institutions Biblically justified. In breath, chastises idolising old authorities like Aristotle, less squashes Hellenic classics pontifical champions. Hobbes quite piece work, yet I think noted simply power-hungry tyrant breeches: throughout work becomes apparent (at least me) led extraordinary lucidity logic (as great men are) greatly influenced desperate desire law order, midst bloody British scuffles 17th century. Now, I'm going spend much time pointing weaknesses Hobbes' exposition. It obvious totalitarian leader cannot quell and, indeed, even incites dissent, especially chosen majority entire people. It also questionable point allow Soveraigne choose successor simply referring people instituted Soveraigne first place - unlike Hobbes thought, means crystal clear coming generations equally chuffed honcho. And say power institute absolute ruler yet cannot abrogate institution? So I'm favour Hobbes suggests herein, yet mean book tremendously good treatise power politics. Its inspirational scope gives much food thought, way constructed influenced certain extent. I personally think Hobbes right underlining idea society, is, ensure peace first foremost, fascinating ponder extent Soveraigne's interference justified today form democratic government. At stage, I nothing questions eyes full wonder, yet clear Hobbes inspired terrified me. Finally, even though modern times really use model governance, one question remains empathic centuries: ""If Hobbes even partially right nature Man, extent ideas advisable?""","318 reviews

Elia Mantovani,"Sicuramente una lettura affascinante e necessaria per inserirsi nell'universo della storia del pensiero politico. Come osserva Galli nella prefazione, la sfida al Leviatano regalista e contrattualista è stato il fulcro degli sviluppi politici del secolo scorso ed indubbiamente si tratta di un'opera teorica tra le più fortunate nel suo campo. Personalmente (ma mi pare che molta critica condivida) ho trovato le prime due sezioni il vero cuore pulsante dell'opera mentre le ultime due, di spiccata intenzione teologico-ecclesiologica, appestantiscono l'altrimenti schematico e cristallino rigore argomentativo di Hobbes che, questi luoghi, si abbastadona all'esegesi scritturale ed all' piuttosto che alla logica che invece sostanzia primi capitoli.","132 reviews

Konstantin Bobov,"Книга состоит из трех частей - foundation knowledge, разговоры о государстве (основная линия) и рассуждения о христианском государстве (по большому счету, трактовка библейских текстов в том направлении, которое было важно в годы написания). Первые две части, конечно, довольно нудны, как и вся философия, но хватает там и интересных мыслей. Например, что люди по природе своей сразу начнут войну всех против всех, ведь мы эгоисты в душе, и лишь государство - Левиафан - может ограничить это саморазрушительное человеческое желание. И именно для ограничения воинственных намерений люди и объединяются в государства - а не зачем-то иным.","46 reviews

Carol Apple,"Leviathan The Matter, Forme Power Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall Civil one difficult reading experiences, well worth effort. The text hard understand; although dense, Hobbes' writing smooth silk interlaced subtle dry wit. I found 17th century English unexpected delight. For drollness perfect understated humor. The difficult part I highly resistant case Hobbes making: case highly authoritarian form government, preferably hereditary monarchy. I always hated idea authoritarian government let alone monarchy reading I still care it. However I must admit I see Hobbes coming from. This book demonstrated that, intelligence, reasoning skills, dash dry humor, make strong case pretty much anything. considered scholars foundational work modern political theory. Published 1651, innovative, original, laid groundwork social science politics framing concepts ""social contract"". Hobbes employs persuasive reason explore source limits state authority. It breaks barriers thought, punctures assumptions, dares challenge authority church. Yes, authority church challenged Hobbes - e.g. Henry VIII, Martin Luther, most, relevantly, Oliver Cromwell. But Hobbes goes explains point point church authority world misinterpreted scripture advantage. Hobbes apparently peace-loving soul gifted scholar. He born 1588 I'm Malmesbury, right time England conflict Spanish Armada. There story born prematurely mother (whose name nobody knows) took fright heard approaching Armada. When young, clergyman father disgraced fight another vicar forced leave family. Thomas brother sister ended raised unmarried uncle. Not much known childhood except received excellent education showed early signed promising scholar. His first post-college jog tutor son wealthy family named Cavindish. This family became sponsor protector throughout life – life included violent political times, protection may preserved life. He worked tutor throughout long life, even short time tutoring Prince Wales, gig seems benefitted old age Prince Wales became King Charles II. In middle age lived English Civil War Charles I dethroned Oliver Cromwell party. Hobbes heard king’s beheading eye witness much upset event well civil unrest crazed violence period. I read conflicting accounts English Civil War may may inspired Hobbes write . From I discern already thought much political theory years war broke out, writing several treatises aspects it, perhaps war, loss good friend violence, beheading king intensified efforts get book print. The book, published 1651, caused quite uproar offended pretty much parties. That indicator must-read! You’d think least Royalists would love book since unapologetic defense powerful monarchy. But no. Apparently wanted kill author. Some Royalists Catholic book absolutely skewers Catholic Church. Others Anglican book flattering either. Also, despite apparent support monarchy, underhanded way Hobbes makes point sovereign reigns consent people certain obligations social contract. This big departure idea king’s authority comes straight God - idea known divine right kings. The idea social contract sovereign subjects around long Hobbes, redefined presented radical new theory works mechanistic terms necessary wellbeing humanity. Hobbes calls Government state led sovereign , concept got . He calls leviathan state “an artificial man” artificial body, sovereign head, serves protect humans much horrible alternative: living state nature. In explaining idea state nature, Hobbes writes passage famous for: You can’t write review Leviathan without quoting that. Hobbes goes quite time section explaining state nature humans live constant state war fear war. Nothing illegal therefore life big free-for-all taking killing benefit tribe. He blame mankind this. We can’t help are, sooner face fact humans incapable living happy peace without strong government, sooner able live happily within necessities artificial world created civil government. The book scientific materialistic secular tone continues offend today. Hobbes says cannot imagine anything really existing without body objective existence. Dreams ghosts result imagination deriving physical origin working internal parts brain. They reality. And yet Catholic Church found many ways use supposed spiritual beings control people gain money. I materialist, cannot deny history. Hobbes make much Jesus’ words “My kingdom world.” In fact, half book makes case biblical scriptures. Which kind funny, scholars say Hobbes either atheist, agnostic, deist. From reading Leviathan guess deist. I suppose Bible hold people time, wants show even Bible supports case. As scholar knows Bible deeply thoroughly, quoting extensively Old New Testaments. It’s good thing I read Tolstoy Walter Wink, show Bible supports civil disobedience anarchy. Otherwise I might fallen Hobbe’s arguments. (Read widely folks. I middle aged horizons still widening every book I read, I know I far go I form definite conclusion. I beginning think conclusion wait I spent couple thousand years great library sky.) divided three parts called, , . Part Three, longest, Hobbes takes Catholic Church religion general, making full use Bible make case. He spends lot time explaining Pope state sovereign cannot share power. A leviathan cannot two heads. But king commands something conscience laws religion worship god? Then, says Hobbes, worship king god: The positive side Hobbes preservation life. The goal civil arrangement many people possible might live good long reasonably content life — avoid early death nasty brutish life. He thinks living rebelling strong state best way make happen. There exceptions - reasons someone might want disobey sovereign. For example: So point religious leader might consider risking martyrdom engaging little civil disobedience. But goes say average joe absolutely good reason risk bodily harm symbolic ceremony. I loved language. You’ll notice consistency spelling, capitalization, punctuation. And yet droll style lends well subtle humor sarcasm. Several times I found laughing aloud words like “Scandalizeth.” It probably seems funnier Hobbes, although plenty deliberate wit throughout book.","133 reviews

Brandy Cross,"This beautifully written. Satire, humor, intelligence, wit, empathy, boldly challenging narrative demands think, even context modern century – would titillating upon release. Today stands incredibly well-written important examination social contract place government society and, whether agree conclusions, powerful one. Part 1 bold (and fairly good) attempt categorizing social aspects human condition basis defining humans exists groups state. Much still applicable today, nearly 400 years later. This Incredibly brazen - While Casually talking collective social consciousness utilize words agree facts words thus reduce thinking understand subject: (e.g. define isosceles triangle 2 equal sides 2 equal angles anyone sees shall know without calculate), “if combinations words contradict agreed-upon knowledge, dismiss combinations utter nonsense. Take “ round quadrangle” “free will” - Aristotle prideful douchebag somehow thought intelligence made suited lead men lesser intelligence submit him. What nitwit. - insert concise argument religions made bullshit ... oh uhh uhh God everyone around dogmatically believes in. I uhh believe divine power stuff - You can’t expect person who’s primary concerns he’s going eat tomorrow ability concern “morality right law” - You wouldn’t call church business person would child. Why bothering “giving non-people rights” nonsense. Part 2 This impressively complex theory social contract. It obviously misses loses context modern developments modern governments, remarkably nuanced time. It defines nuance value social contract, valuate it’s merit people based chose it. In modern terms, white Americans tied social contract chose benefited it. Black Americans every right tear social contract go rebuild suppressed it. I’m less interested aspects surrounding choosing government best government forms government considerably matured last 300 years. This rational based outdated information written pressure conforming standards appearing heretical insurgent. - Those willing join social contract must fight consumed - state must maintain behavior (moral conduct) people preserve value people. - The protection state extends death sentence. “For seeing every subject author actions sovereign, punishes another actions committed himself”. E.g. state responsible actions people. So state sets situation people must loot steal achieve needs, state responsible killing them, state failing people. - Defining rights state rights people state. The power sovereign power people put together. The ruler powerful subjects thus must submit whole. The state cannot ban dissent riots. - Hobbes defines government one man rules monarchy - complexities fall 3 categories complexities time? This outdated worthless think today - The passions men potent reason. - The wealth monarch utterly depends wealth people. His outcome tied theirs. Does logic still hold true? In democracy aristocracy (small groups wealthy people ruling) rulers easily profiteer people. Unsure logic based on? Other forms government could salary tied wealth lowest wage people. - Single rulers fewer options corruption fewer options distribute power favor individuals. Hobbes leans favor single ruler - I disagree - It responsibility sovereign ensure next sovereign prepared rule. Right rule blood silly? If follow Christian idea representatives god (which includes ruler) take wives, rulers cannot either. Right rule formal decision sovereign power preferred. Albeit flawed heavily corruptible. - Social contract families woman man’s power child woman’s power - thus man controls both. He doesn’t talk terms morality absolutism. But product time. People obliged, like children, subjected take care them. Slaves, forced relationship, obligation. If father taking care you, beholden extent. If someone subjugated you, moral obligation. Again, outdated interesting. - Limiting power sovereign requires subjugating oneself greater, limiting power. I think Short-sighted theory. Checks balances create limitations without creating greater power. However, subjugation power remains So theory correct least part. You create multiple powers equal power get around this. - No sovereign command person something harms them, emotionally physically. A person may decline harm harm others, understanding may bring harm others depending scruples similar feelings subjects. - A man’s ability submit social contract governed ability understand it. If someone borrows money good faith understand terms, bound them. If someone understand know law, cannot hold it. It governments responsibility ensure people educated. - Offering monopolies merchants, like politicians, results losses everyone involved - every man obliged learn laws applying - No man held accountable crime necessary preserve life family - Raping married woman worse crime raping unmarried woman. Seducing woman crime. Outdated silly good measure times. - It weak belief relies divine inspiration rather study inspire faith. - Which kingdom divided itself, cannot stand. P250 - It dangerous allow people win sway popular vote charisma. This true. Trump. Nixon. The popular vote valuable dangerous opinion, could used actually mitigate danger? Certainly monarchy Hobbes suggests. - A government allows populace remain uneducated easier control failing people. - “Shall whole nations brought acquiesce great mysteries Christian religion, reason; millions men made [to] believe body innumerable places, one time, reason; shall men able, teaching, preaching, protected law, make received consonant reason, unprejudicated man needs learn it, hear it? I conclude therefore instruction people essential rights [] consequently [the sovereign’s] duty cause instructed. - When people unable work provide themselves, commonwealth must them. - It difficult impossible government call Christian yet governments try err Christianity This examination social contract light Christianity would inescapable time. This section examines, questions, pokes fun at, seriously gives weight moral judicial responsibilities Christian commonwealth according scripture. This section also highlights many ways religion religious texts could wrong, course, Christian Bible. - someone doesn’t believe religion part religious commonwealth, it’s responsibility change faith, otherwise absolves men social contract - Passages Bible cherry picked law. E.g. “abstain water drink wine” law - It pope’s place judge king heretical. Henry viii died 4 years published, England would arms legitimacy leaving papacy. How much defense maintaining status quo monarchy? Part four examines failings philosophy religion used support (then) modern government thought. This fairly complex heavily aimed religion. “And man consider original great ecclesiastical dominion, easily perceive Papacy ghost deceased Roman Empire, sitting crowned upon grave thereof. “ The Ecclesiastes take young men use reason, certain charms compounded metaphysics miracles traditions abused scriptures, whereby good nothing else execute command them. The faeries likewise said take young children cradles change natural fools. In shop operators fairies make enchantment, old wives determined. But operations clergy well known. “To conclude, nothing whole discourse [], far I perceive, contrary either word god good manners disturbance public tranquility. Therefore I think may profitability printed profitably taught universities” Principles: without social contract men lawless reason kill and/or rob benefit. Without government; social contract guided solely individual morals which, may enough, many individuals not. This written context wars, poverty, empires - won’t simply take whatever wanted. This written as: “people band together agree social contract risk people governments”. The social contract exists without government, government enforces gives people way enforce without resorting honor culture, every man must defend rights social contract (leading breaking social contract). We agree honor culture bad. Questions: men lawless ? government restricted Hobbes seems think? Can defend predatory third party governments don’t commonwealth defend? Monarchy - points time monarchies norm. One doesn’t disregard question bread food source bread eat day day out. Hobbes formalizes monarchies efficient leviathan government predictable, stable, less prone corruption, heavily reliant wealth people success. Government notably evolved since then, and, tied silly ideas heretability divine right rule, options. In fact, could much incorporate Hobbes fears create beneficial structures: * tie presidential salaries economy minimum wage. * Institute better laws banning cronyism nepotism * Integrate checks balances government prevent one party taking power easily. No 2 party system, spoils systems, winner take systems. Popular vote: Men informed ill equipped make rational choice leader instead choose based charisma. * formalize political education school * Ban election advertisements * Ban rallies * Formalize election process solely based intellectual arguments ideas candidates * Make vote certain number hours education mandatory In general, dated. But principles social contract outlined remain powerful ultimately useful. I can’t help wonder Hobbes would written light modern freedom speech modern government, alas.","134 reviews

Jefther Vieira,"Enquanto dirigia ouvi pelo rádio alguém dizendo que “Hobbes achava humanidade depravada e por isso dizia que homem era lobo homem”. Eis uma associação que nos acompanha desde ensino médio. Eu substituiria essa pequena fórmula pela resposta seguinte pergunta – que fazer quando não se gosta governante? Hobbes responde: dito governante tem mesmas chances de sair vivo dessa que você e, além disso, ideologiazinhas e esqueminhas de governo dele são tão ruins e erradas quanto suas. Logo, qual aperreio? Como é uma solução um tanto anticlimática, suponho que lobo é frase que vai ficar. Gente mais culta pensa diferente sobre assunto e, citando Carpeaux, posso resumir lhes pensamento assim: Carpeaux e outros defendem postulamento natural individualismo de Hobbes e que fez assim partir da ciência. Nesse caso deslindaremos algumas sutilezas para ver até onde se sustenta. Primeiramente esse “individualismo” já era postulado por alguns escolásticos. Depois há influência tacitismo. Hobbes é um humanista e humanismo é uma ideia como também um mundo - os renascentistas, por exemplo, viveram em Platão e Cícero com fãs vivem em Star Wars e MCU. O tacitismo contém um sentimento de decadência da civilização antiga e bebe estoicismo e epicurismo. A barbárie na Roma tardia, grosseira e sanguinolenta, vai vencendo civilização na corrida e se afasta em milhas. A lição sábio é apathia, consciência superior da natureza e dos homens, indiferença ante escaramuças políticas e vitória sobre medos desnecessários. A lição de Hobbes não é outra. O tacitismo é que liga Hobbes Bacon, Lipsius e Montaigne. Os antigos gregos e romanos julgaram buscar um mas Verdade descortinada por Hobbes depois de séculos de degeneração é que apenas há evitar um . Embora muito perto florescer da nação inglesa, temos em Hobbes menos um bom selvagem assinando contrato social que um Sêneca, um filósofo esfarelamento da sociedade assistindo imperturbável. Não comentarei fundo sistema que Hobbes construiu para realizar esse projeto filosófico, apenas penso que basta indicar um de seus pilares, qual seja rejeição da concepção inocente de que “sujeito percebe objeto” em favor de “o sujeito percebe uma representação objeto” e por isso é impossível existência de um discurso unívoco, absoluto e verdadeiramente objetivo mesmo na mais exata das ciências. Aqui ciência moderna e ceticismo antigo se unem na descrição da condição que é verdadeiro mal mundo, relativismo cognitivo pois gera narrativas irreconciliáveis. A única certeza é materialidade dos fatos e mais rente elevação disso é uma mera versão pessoal. Ao ser humano resta como direito fundamental, portanto, manutenção corpo e suas funções vitais enquanto sua vida interior é relegada à esfera privada e excluída da política. Tendo como único fator comum autopreservação, narrativas concorrentes se batem contra outras na “guerra de todos contra todos”; guerra mais das vezes sem qualquer violência, que transcorre através dos meios mais sutis. Além disso há verdade revelada na Bíblia mas Hobbes interpreta de modo esvaziá-la de qualquer relevância política, obrigando leitores de outrora e de hoje conceder lhe título de ateísta cristão. A cosmovisão de Hobbes afasta dos tacitistas quando estes abrem uma janela ao renascimento, um “reacionarismo” à época de ouro seja judaico-cristã ou greco-romana. Hobbes crê solução numa nova visão da República. A mensagem final de Hobbes é: os antigos eram boas pessoas e eles tentaram possível, buscando um bem maior, para criar uma sociedade pacífica, atingindo apenas guerras civis, discórdia e separação de Deus. Nós somos piores, mas por experiência podemos construir uma república que evite mal pior, reduzindo nossas expectativas e nos conformando em seguir que está aí. Livros geralmente são escritos para que seus autores recebam algo, mesmo que gratidão dos leitores; mas nenhum livro desgraçou tanto um autor quanto “Leviatã”. O livro fez perder dinheiro, posição e amigos. Também é um livro totalmente anacrônico. A quem quiser ler, há dois pontos que são esclarecidos: primeiro, numa democracia noção de “guerra de todos contra todos” ajuda ver política de modo algébrico, isto é, retirando quanto possível conteúdo das causas políticas e observar dinâmica das forças políticas em jogo. Depois, numa tirania, população quase nunca é engajada na política partido; antes, há um acordo tácito onde ditador pode fazer que quiser desde que não ponha em risco salvaguarda dos seus cidadãos. O caso prático da quebra parcial de um contrato desse tipo está aí para quem quiser ver...","106 reviews

Mladen,"Philosophical masterpiece! I've seen lot highly critical reviews Hobbes. Most people read The Leviathan sort contemporary lens without fully understanding historical context The Leviathan written. It simply make sense critiquing Hobbes without understanding social situation time things influenced construction ideas. Considering time, Hobbes one understandable relatable thinkers whose ideas applicable even today. At beginning book, provided complete glossary terms possible misinterpretations text fully fault. The writing style completely understandable today's perspective can't said lot philosophers. Only two things make Hobbes man ahead time. The ideas Leviathan controlling nation many consider apologetic stance towards dictatorships, totalitarian regimes etc. I consider irrelevant argument since Hobbes lived 17th century possibly predict contemporary concept dictatorship. Neither could predict industrial revolution etc. Now, considering aspects allowed criticize Hobbes, perspective time. The Leviathan reaction chaos caused English Civil War. Seeing happens revolutions, Hobbes became deeply skeptical spirit brings forth revolutionary movements. He saw revolutions manifestations peoples pathetic, little interests interest society general. Mainly attacked clusterfuck Cromwell caused. Cromwell's rule resulted lot dead souls, unnecessary destruction finally unavoidable return monarchy death. Basically, whole affair sort fiasco Hobbes' point view. He perceived aftermath revolution resulted brighter future rather unstable government. From perspective, Hobbes would highly critical towards Stalin, Hitler dictator overthrew legitimate government order impose new order based ideology. But order imposed, Hobbes' reasoning would imply peoples' fault letting happen. Concerning ideas man evil, Hobbes technically right. Consider fully direct democracy everyone intervene voice opinion anything. It would completely chaotic nothing would ever done would always find certain group people would, reason, disagree implementation certain policy. This is, basically reason representative democracies direct democracies small scales. The concept simply seem applicable national level.

Constantino Casasbuenas,"Hobbes, Thomas Leviatan, la Materia, Forma Poder de una República Eclesiástica Civil Fondo de Cultura Económica, México 1994 (Primera edición en inglés es de 1651) Leyendo el prefacio, queda claro que es importante leer sobre el contexto de Inglaterra en ése entonces. Hobbes nació en 1588 murió en 1679, coincidiendo parte de su vida con la de Descartes Newton. “Es lenguaje universal, sin medida de tiempo ni de espacio”, como indica Manuel Sánchez Sarto. No se conocen los nombres del papá de la mamá. El nació cuando la Armada Española llegaba Inglaterra. Luego fue teniendo muy buena educación llegó la universidad de Oxford. No confió en los Escolásticos. Me llama la atención que el libro (600p) tiene tres grandes partes: el hombre, el estado las tinieblas. Me sorprendió encontrar que en la primera parte entra definir el significado de las palabras, para llegar formar frases, juicios, conocimiento, etc., etc. Es muy poderoso el método por ello se le considera como fundador de la filosofía política moderna. Me gustó mucho el capítulo XII, sobre la religión. Solo el ser humano la tiene. “…nada sugiere la razón, deja que cada uno persista en ella o, para otras ceremonias, confíe en quienes considere más sabios”. 90 Dos tipos de seres humanos: (a) quienes ordenan la religioso de acuerdo con su propia invención (feligreses más aptos para la obediencia), (b) bajo el mando dirección de Dios (política divina). Fue interesante el entrar en las Leyes Naturales los Contratos, la transferencia de derechos. Por un lado se acerca uno los acuerdos de la palabra de la ley (un tris enredado), por otro (interesantes!) lo que son las “conversaciones para la acción”, que están la base de Facebook, Twitter, las diferentes redes sociales. El concepto de buscar la paz aparece como central (v. Cap IXV, p.107). La segunda parte está dedicada al Estado. Los pactos descansan en la espada, pues tenemos el principio de organización (o la falta de honores dignidad) que sí tienen las abejas las hormigas. Estamos entonces ante la necesidad de conformar el gran Leviatán (“el dios mortal , al cual debemos, bajo el Dios inmortal, nuestra paz nuestra defensa”. 141 Ocurre por adquisición (fuerza natural) por institución (los hombres se ponen de acuerdo entre sí). Es un rico capítulo porque entra en varios de los “detalles” grandes de la Revolución Inglesa (English Civil War). En la página 149 entra en los detalles de aquel momento. Hemos creado un hombre artificial llamado Estado cadenas artificiales llamadas leyes civiles. “Tanto si el Estado es monárquico, como si es popular, la libertad es siempre la misma”. 175 Es muy interesante el tratamiento que hace del mercado del comercio, que alimenta bien los procesos de los TLCs actuales. P.191 Atención los cuerpos privados regulares, pero ilegales. Igual vale para quienes se proponen el gobierno de la religión. En el simil que hace entre hombre Estado gustó: • “… es cuanto tengo que decir respecto los sistemas asambleas del pueblo, que pueden ser comparadas, como digo, las partes semejantes del cuerpo humano; las legítimas los músculos; las ilegales los tumores, cálculos apostemas, engendrados por la antinatural confluencia de humores malignos”. • “Es la razón del Estado, nuestro hombre artificial sus mandamientos, lo que constituye la ley”.222 • “Por consiguiente, las leyes de la naturaleza necesitan ni publicación ni promulgación, ya que están contenidas en esta sentencia, aprobada por todo el mundo: No hagas otro lo que tú consideres irrazonable que otro te haga ti”. 223 • “La ley de naturaleza se convierte en la más oscura de todas las leyes, es, por consiguiente, la más necesitada de intérpretes capaces”. 226 • Leviatán (cap 41 de Job), “Dios, habiendo establecido el gran poder del Leviatán, le denomina rey de la arrogancia. Nada existe sobre la tierra que pueda compararse con él. Está hecho para sentir el miedo.”262 • “No existe acción humana en esta vida que sea el comienzo de una cadena de consecuencias, tan larga, que ninguna providencia humana es lo bastante elevada para dar al hombre una perspectiva del fin”. 303 Traté de leer con juicio la Tercera Parte, más referida al Estado Cristiano. Es un poco como regresar al primer capítulo (definición de términos), pero en relación con Dios, los libros sagrados los personajes rito de todo tipo que aparecen: profetas, discípulos, Cristo, la resurrección, la ascensión, los apóstoles, rol de Pedro, sacerdotes, un largo etc. que nos lleva al cielo, al infierno al purgatorio; también Roma al Sumo Pontífice. En las distintas partes hay referencias personajes de la época respectiva, pero le vi sentido en seguirlo. Me gustó mucho estas 4 palabras que tienen mucha fuerza: “Mi presencia irá contigo”. 332 Otra importante: “Todo hombre debe examinar la probabilidad de una supuesta vocación de profeta”. 358 Interesante como se plantea la relación entre el Sumo Pontífice la autoridad civil. La Parte Cuatro pareció sensacional pues muestra cómo el catolicismo arma todo su andamiaje para mostrar su representación de Dios. Me gustó mucho el tratamiento que hace del Papa, las órdenes de sacerdotes el matrimonio. Muy impresionante como indica que la jerarquía plena del Papa es el reino de las tinieblas reino de las brujas.574 El final de esta parte es sensacional: “No fue, por consiguiente, cosa difícil, para Enrique VIII pesar del exorcismo, ni para la reina Isabel pesar del suyo, expulsarlos” Me toca mirar: • Qué entiende Hobbes por hombres de ánimo femenino? • Quiero entender “El hombre es el sexo más excelente” • Quiénes fueron “las Amazonas” (163) quienes contrataban hombres de los países vecinos? • En p. 167 entra en los derechos de la Monarquía gracias las Escrituras. Reconocer el Bien el Mal depende del árbol de la ciencia. “La destreza en hacer mantener los Estados descansa en ciertas normas, semejantes las de la aritmética la geometría, no, (como en el juego del tennis) en la práctica solamente: estas reglas, ni los hombres pobres tienen tiempo ni quienes tienen ocios suficientes han tenido la curiosidad el método de encontrarlas”. 170 • Ubicar rol e importancia (¿) de los escolásticos. • Me parece importante mirar la vida el rol del cardenal Belarmino su rol en la iglesia dentro de la Inquisición, los juicios de Galileo de Giordano Bruno. • Leer San Bernardo, quien está en la base del árbol de los existencialistas. • Reina Isabel (1533 – 1603) la eliminación del poder de los papas.","102 reviews

Pilar,"En esta obra de filosofía política se muestra el pensamiento de Hobbes acerca del ser humano, que se puede muy bien resumir en la frase ""Homo homini lupus"", frase que fue tomada por el filósofo de Asinaria, obra del comediógrafo latino Plauto (s.III-II a.C). Para Hobbes el estado natural agresivo narcisista del ser humano, que para nada empatiza con el sufrimiento miserias de las demás personas, le lleva una lucha continua contra los demás seres humanos. Prueba de ello, las guerras constantes través de la historia de la humanidad por conseguir poder dominio sobre otros pueblos. Desgraciadamente estoy bastante de acuerdo con él, tan sólo quizá pequeñas excepciones se puedan encontrar de seres humanos que hayan podido/querido superar esa agresividad falta de empatía innatas. //This work political philosophy shows Hobbes' thought human being, well summarized phrase ""Homo homini lupus"", phrase taken philosopher , work Latin playwright Plautus (3rd-2nd century BC). For Hobbes, aggressive narcissistic natural state human beings, empathize suffering miseries people, leads continuous struggle human beings. Proof this, constant wars throughout history humanity gain power dominance peoples. Unfortunately I quite agree him, only, perhaps, small exceptions found human beings able/wanted overcome innate aggressiveness lack empathy.","287 reviews

Varad,"Just every aspect Hobbes' immeasurably influential treatise subject centuries' worth scrutiny analysis: characterization human life state nature ""nasty, brutish, [and] short""; conception sovereignty demand unequivocal indivisible, rival source power legitimacy allowed within commonwealth, whether form individual dissent alternative sources power church; conception possible civic religion; numerous subjects. The thrust argument leads, ever direction attacks, always one target: absolute power state, secure unmatched. Hobbes' justification absolutism grounds alone maintain peace sanctity state, would otherwise riven squabbles, disputes, strife - political religious - tearing asunder Europe middle seventeenth century controversial moment issued press. There's nothing I add debate. I want emphasize two aspects book tend get lost shuffle. The first Hobbes discusses many topics textbook summaries give reader inkling expect. The book starts politics long summation epistemology metaphysics, matters Hobbes reverts time time way end. He spends considerable time attacking views opponents reasons holding them; Catholic Church scholasticism subject several fulsome barrages. The last two hundred pages book are, less, devoted biblical criticism exegesis. The end always vindicate Hobbes' conception sovereignty (by, case, eroding grounds Catholic Church pope propagated defended temporal power); careful scrupulous exegete glossator, quite tedious reader, buried citation citation chapter verse. The second unexpected feature book language. Hobbes nothing less master English prose, one finest eloquent stylists. Perhaps powerful compelling rhetorical gifts command metaphor: nothing less Homeric. Take example description scholars intent maintaining categories seeking genuine knowledge, go astray: ""From whence happens, trust books, cast many little summs greater, without considering whether little summes rightly cast not; last finding errour visible, mistrusting first grounds, know way cleere themselves; spend time fluttering bookes; birds entring chimney, finding inclosed chamber, flitter false light glasse window, want wit consider way came in"" (28). Or consider one near end book, also errors follies Hobbes' intellectual foes: ""But purpose (may man say) subtilty work nature, I pretend nothing necessary doctrine Government Obedience? It purpose, men may longer suffer abused, them, doctrine Separated Essences, built Vain Philosophy Aristotle, would fright Obeying Laws Countrey, empty names; men fright Birds Corn empty doublet, hat, crooked stick"" (465). Which perhaps say, bad thinking straw-man! Nor Hobbes without sense humor, notes, ridiculing existence ghosts, whenever sighted, never fails ""their clothes appear in"" manifest, (466). The great irony Hobbes wielded metaphor profound fluency persuasion decrying capacity gull weak-minded. To ""use words metaphorically; is, sense ordained for; thereby deceive others"" one ""abuses speech"" Hobbes enumerates early chapter ""On Speech"" (26). It charge reiterates throughout. ""[T]he use Metaphors, Tropes, Rhetoricall figures, stead words proper"" one causes absurd reasoning. ""For though lawfull say, (for example) common speech, The Way Goeth, Or Leadeth Hither, Or Thither, The Proverb Sayes This Or That (whereas wayes cannot go, Proverbs speak;) yet reckoning, seeking truth, speeches admitted"" (35). Indeed, far concerned, ""Metaphors, senslesse ambiguous words, like ; reasoning upon them, wandering amongst innumerable absurdities; end, contention, sedition, contempt"" (36). Never counselor use metaphor proffering advise, metaphor's innate tendency mislead stir passions (180). Yet Hobbes says too, describing characteristics natural intellect wit: ""Besides Discretion times, places, persons, necessary good Fancy, required also often application thoughts End; say, use made them. This done; hath Vertue, easily fitted similitudes, please, onely illustration discourse, adorning new apt metaphors; also, rarity invention"" (51). On score least may said Hobbes guilty false modesty. complex, demanding, difficult, long. It requires much reader. But repays much return. It bears deserves attention reader give it. It canonical text ever one. But becomes clear page page dense, often archaic prose, Hobbes book earned place it.

São ecos que remetem ao pensamento latino de epicuro, mas retorcidos pela vivência assombrosa da revolução inglesa, com seus gritos ouvidos por um jovem Hobbes, em Westminster.

John,"I’ll preface review saying I’ve read Books I-II Leviathan (about half), close friend recently told me, “That may new record.” Although title refers ideal leader state, could easily attributed book itself; it’s truly exhaustive, exhausting, development Hobbes’ theory political government, took 2 months sort first 400-odd pages. Besides girth, first thing I would say usually dissuades readers Hobbes’ masterwork fact many theories government discarded last 300 years. He fan representative democracy – held largely pessimistic view collective human nature – viewed absolute rule one centralized authority form government capable controlling large groups people conflicting goals opinions. That said, kept reading first two books rigorously completely develops theories government basic anatomic principles universal truths. It goes something like this: In Book I, entitled “Of Man,” Hobbes uses scientific principles time show human body operates world, gaining knowledge competing human bodies supremacy; is, parlance Locke, Rousseau, Hume 16th 17th Century philosophers, State Nature, Hobbes words makes every human life “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, short.” (I suspect Hobbes, using biblical references terminology, closet atheist, view human nature survival Darwinist well Darwin. I’ve found least one religious zealot book inventory agrees me, missionary named Paul Hutchinson wrote book called “The New Leviathan” directly WWII comparing communist governments Russia China ideal all-powerful state power Hobbes set forth Leviathan. Of course, Hutchinson doesn’t mind playing sides coin, also referring fascist regimes Mussolini Hitler Hobbesian terms one chapter entitled “The Worship ‘Mortal God’.”) It’s interesting ironic Hobbes Book I derides educators philosophers Aristotle, Cicero, St. Thomas Aquinas use metaphors, empirical understanding absolute thus reliable (“For words wise mens counters, reckon them: mony fooles” – Chapter 4), since Book II Leviathan, “Of Commonwealth,” relies entirely upon metaphor government functioning human body. To mind, every functional nation world state nature (in words, state war) every nation. This, mind, nations formed – [CUT] protect citizens, i.e., parts body, harm nations, i.e., political bodies. The way Hobbes saw – Hobbes aged worst – enforced dictatorial rule, way keep people breaking civil natural laws fear retribution (to fair, Hobbes wrote Leviathan exile one England’s bloodiest civil wars, primary political motive ending internal conflict). I think reason opinion universally decried ideologies either end political spectrum something like – free-market advocates see competition Hobbes wanted eliminate ideal ruling power; centralized oligarchical rule exactly liberal constitutionalists created social contracts against; religious fundamentalists continually arms government conflicts tenets. Jane Jacobs introduction The Death Life Great American Cities rails urban planners time wrote (it first published 1961) “earnest learned men, dealing complex phenomena understand trying make pseudoscience.” I probably wouldn’t use strong language Hobbes’ political philosophy, principle similar – Hobbes may gotten wrong, got wrong better us gotten right.","58 reviews

Ara, en canvi, temo encara més la concepció antropològica de l'autor: darrere del Leviatan hi ha un home soberà, qui se li cedeix un poder absolut il'limitat, fet que, segons Hobbes, és sempre preferible qualsevol forma de llibertat, ja que sense la por al càstig del Leviatan l'ésser humà està condemnat una vida miserable.","23 reviews

Arjun Ravichandran,"Thomas Hobbes’ ‘Leviathan’ written turmoil English Civil war – conflict caused precisely sort divided sovereignty rails seminal text. The book therefore filled glimpses seething sarcasm, quite unbecoming austere English political philosopher. Nonetheless, Hobbes aim tract clear – intends offer ‘science politics’. His definition science particular, informed parallel careers geometer mathematician. He therefore shares Euclid, Spinoza, ambition towards philosophical construction built irrefutable axioms. Part Hobbes’ reputation greatness rests difficulty enterprise ; Euclid dramas defining line stretching two points. Hobbes, dealing messy raw material human psychology, task attempting similar axiomatic approach. Therefore, Leviathan begins long discussion human nature, predicated resolutely materialistic grounds. External stimuli stimulates (as stimuli wont do) sense organs, giving rise motion within. This motion, called sense, turn gives rise imagination – again, term defined carefully Hobbes, meaning picture causal relationship. Imagination requires mark hold place, thus language comes play. Language also important verifying imagination (and thus causal picture external world) peers. The social sedimentation floating signifiers language, gives rise reason – abstract weighing causality, typified syllogism. (One book’s rather entertaining detours, Hobbes’ condescending treatment ‘insignificant speech’, arises, view, uprooting words proper place, using inappropriate contexts ; ‘an incorporeal body’, example. Parallels Wittgenstein abundant. In underrated line text, Hobbes asserts ‘the privilege reason also privilege absurdity.’) This mechanistic picture human allows Hobbes postulate ‘natural laws’- pointedly, man everywhere aims avoid death, actualize well-being, however defines it, whatever implements hand. With move, path towards science politics begins. The discussion motion, sense, imagination, incipient reason, desire self-preservation avoidance harm, concomitant desire unsubtle self-actualization, postulation natural laws encompass these, allows Hobbes posit fundamental axiom science – ‘state nature’. Given men fundamentally equal desire flourish, parallel distrust other’s capacity same, state war pertains. While Hobbes makes scattered remarks regarding actuality state nature, either past, time, I find best think abstract entity, much manner perfect circle exists. It given axiom, structure argument, well results obtains, hold water. It discussion state nature, famous line, man’s life environment ‘nasty, brutish short’ finds place. However, doom gloom – men reason stems instinct self-preservation/self-actualization, intuit war results destruction all. They thus decide abrogate natural liberty jointly invest sovereign, culminating commonwealth. The rest Hobbes’ analysis deals nature sovereign – eponymous Leviathan. With geometric absolutism, Hobbes insists power sovereign absolute. Any attempt partition power mean undermining power – everywhere Hobbes hangs spectre return state nature haunting commonwealth, lest principle absolute sovereignty adhered to. It sovereign alone absolutely free – act lights best interests commonwealth – subjects, agreed arrangement (or ‘covenanted’ so, Hobbes puts it) ordained powerless regard. It compelling argument, amongst finer examples social-contract theory, well primitively prefiguring game-theory. Some queries remain however – firstly insistence men agree freely transfer portion natural liberty common sovereign. The key word ‘freely’ – Hobbes insists freedom pertains, even picture gathering tribesmen anointing king, alternatively, freeman threatened knife-point swear allegiance. The argument here, I take it, fear common arrangements ; one hand, fear one’s fellows hypothetical state nature, other, fear immediate bodily harm alien sovereign. That one called free, so, absurdity Hobbes’ reckoning. Another doubt pertains treatment children. In delineating authority sovereign stemming free abrogation liberty, Hobbes notes child, natural sovereign father. Analogously, child, fear danger attendant upon vulnerable state, abrogates liberty father. The solidity argument open doubt. I could think Thomas Jefferson’s idle quote, every generation right institute form government. Additionally, even accepting Hobbes’ contention commonwealth underlined absolute sovereignty best possible state civilized man, question remains whether ultimately desirable. What would Hobbes say Proudhon’s exhortation ‘destruction creative endeavour’? Or even, esoterically, Freudian death drive, compelled towards destruction destruction’s sake? To fair Hobbes, admit even perfectly constituted commonwealth, though designed (artificial) immortality, eventually wither – way things. I must say that, I perused latter two divisions book, wherein Hobbes details ideas ‘Christian Commonwealth’, I depthfully first two divisions – simple reason I didn’t find relevant. In conclusion, thought-provoking read fully earns place amongst classics political philosophy – even philosophy proper. It argue one form politics other, goes way towards showing science politics. Without getting bogged normative prescriptions one form political life other, Hobbes endeavours show man indeed political animal, explores political animal, demonstrates must so. His proposed solution fundamental question poses.","219 reviews

Mahmoud Kassem,عشان تدي رأي محايد في اللفياثان لهوبز صعب جدا لأن في الكتاب في اختلاط قوي بين الخراء و الجمال بصورة مشوفتهاش قبل كدا بس خلينا نحاول. هوبز في السياسية في الكتاب ليه مسألتين الأولي بخصوص أفضل شكل للحكومة و الي هو بيشوفها أنها الملكية و من ناحية سلطان الحكومة و دي النظرية الي قضي حياته و هي أن سلطان و سلطات الحكومة لازم يكون مطلق. النظرية دي الحقيقة هي بنت عصر النهضة و الإصلاح ، لأن عصر النهضة بنزعته الإنسانية و العلمية دخل في صراع مع الكنسية و اتسبب في نفس الوقت في ظهور حركة الإصلاح الي استعانت بالملوك ضد الكنيسة بأنها أقرت أن لا سلطان فوق الملوك و أن كل ملك هو رأس كنيسة بلده و بكدا ححرت الملوك من التبعية للبابا و في النهاية انتصرت حركة الإصلاح و الملوك و انتهت سلطة البابا و أنهت حركة الإصلاح علي عصر النهضة بعودة محاكم التفتيش. لكن التخلص من سلطان الكنيسة كان مهم و كان هو مقدمة التخلص من سلطان الملوك لان السلطة الاستبدادية ديما أسهل من السلطة الدينية في التخلص . المهم أن هوبز استوحي موقفه من الظروف دي ، خصوصا انه شاف أن اي مجتمع بيواجه خطرين الفوضي أو الاستبداد و كان بيشوف أن خطر الاستبداد اقل وطئة من الفوضي عشان كدا كان مؤيد ليه. طبعا جه بعده لوك و حسن من النظرية بكلام ع تقاسم السلطات لكن المخيف انك تشوف أن نظرية هوبز لسه هي المتحكمة و السأدة للحظة ازاي؟ أن وظائف الدولة حاليا مهمة جدا الي الناس ، و إنسان ٢٠١٨ أضعف من انسان القرن ال ١٧ لأنه مرفه بشدة، بالتالي الإنسان تحول لطفل رضيع و مقاومته للدولة اصبحت صفرية من كتر اعتماده عليها و ده بيأكد نظرية هوبز الي بيدعم بيها الدولة لانها المنقذ الوحيد من الفوضي حسب رأيه. لكن الحقيقة أن الدول أوقات بتوصل حد من التحلل بيخلي استمرارها مستحيل زي فرنسا ١٧٨٩ و روسيا ١٩١٧ ، + أن امان الحكومات من اي تحرك للشعب بيخليها تلغي مصلحة العامة اصلا لان الدولة الحديثه بتخدم المواطن لسبب البقاء في السلطة في الاساس ، فخوف هوبز من نتائج الفوضي بيتحقق اصلا في نظريته! الشيء الجميل في هوبز و كتابه ده هو تحرره من الخرافة ، هوبز بيشوف الأفكار الدوغماىية ضعف انساني فقط لا غير مناسب لإن��ان الغابة الي كان بيفسر اي شيء لا يعرفه بتفسيرات دوغمائية. لكن هوبز يظل كان محدود جدا فمثلا هو مخدش باله من أن مصالح المواطنين دئما مختلفه و كان بيتعامل معاها ع انها شيء واحد ، الاختلاف الي ماركس شافه هو أساس التغيير الاجتماعي . و ان السلطات لمنع ده بتحاول تجمع الشعب معاها في نفس المصلحة عن طريق الحروب ، لأنه في زمن السلم الناس بتفوق لصراع و صدام الطبقات و بالتالي تقاسم السلطة بيكون أمر حتمي حتي لو بصورة صورية في الاساس .,"2 reviews

At point, I'm impressed -- book published Newton's calculus. He started talk government commonwealth. laid monarch supposed power supposed stuff like that. This little bit irrelevant today's world, see logic still self consistent. For example, explains tyranny different form government monarchy. We call way like it. And started talk Christian commonwealth. This part longest, hardest part endure. He homework, I give that. He extensively quotes scripture. But here, logic completely breaks down. He still logical: mentioned multiple times trust anyone claims revelation God. But somewhere long chapters (I audiobook pin where), sneaked past axioms axioms worded follow natural logic. Remember, person told us can't believe someone prophet simply said himself. But now, discussing little details run christian common wealth (e.g., relationship civil sovereign religious head church), mean incorporeal spirit, whether purgatory, etc. etc., doubting anything bible. His logic boils this: believe wacko claiming messiah prophet; believe christian theology; *because* church blessed it. Don't forget circularity church influence many people believed it. Somewhere there, I think I read confession basically said I believe stuff choice have? Everybody else does. Somebody please tell key merits classic piece.","771 reviews

Fred Dameron,"Leviathan definitely ""Know enemy yourself"" book. The GOP uses Hobbes justification small one man government ""Drowned bathtub"". Unfortunately, GOP religious right fanatics, Hobbes's Leviathan justification majority GOP theologizes is. In many ways Leviathan much like cornerstone book GOP political theory pundits continue quote, The Bible. And quote context incorrectly. In case The Bible famous ""An eye eye tooth tooth."" (Exodus 21:24) look VERY specific circumstances punishment ""If people fighting hit pregnant woman gives birth prematurely serious injury, offender must fined whatever woman's husband demands court allows. But serious injury, take life life, eye eye, tooth tooth, hand hand, foot foot, burn burn, wound wound, bruise bruise."" (Exodus 21: 22-26) NIV. You find justification death penalty one case general justification State take life. For instance many Republicans like New Justice Neil Gorsuch said month ago, I paraphrase, It's Ok municipality Nativity scene front city hall exclude religions posting holiday scene Christian Nation."" The Founding Fathers read Leviathan. Part IV attack State run Religious leader. Now Hobbes attacking Papal States Pope Spiritual Leader Catholic Church also temporal leader. Starting Matthew 10:154 Mark 6:11 ""that town accept leave knock dust sandal."" This leaves Church one way change people PERSUASION. Now ruler also Temporal authority ruler may ALSO COMPEL his/her subjects one religion. This Founding Fathers added Constitution Bill Rights First Amendment says ""Congress shall make law respecting establishment religion, prohibiting free exercise thereof; abridging freedom speech, press; right people peaceably assemble, petition government redress grievances. This NOT Freedom Religion statement ""Christian Nation"" Rt wing GOP would state, Freedom FROM religion last 80 pages Leviathan states. Hobbes specific That Church punish (Section III CH XLII Paragraph 124, That Church tries rule sovereign ""The Kingdom Fairies"" (Section IV CH XLVII paragraph 4-17). This continued point Sovereign, either individual Congressional/Parliamentary body, tries rule authority ecclesiastical temporal authority trying lead civil war, (Part III CH XXXIX Par 5), Civil War inevitable. Not Hobbes discus Civil War also states leaders condemn Hell preach God's Word. Again, specifically aimed Pope applicable todays RT. Wing Religious Fanatics want ""Christian America.""( Section IV, CH XLIV paragraph 1) This may make little queasy given right think turned propagandists GOP inflammatory oration Rt. Wing preachers preach false doctrine. I encourage actually READ Bible, way through, source documents party uses touch stone political theology. Leviathan touch stone foundation work GOP uses, use context incorrectly. There also things I would like see U.S. take Hobbes Leviathan manly way ranks crime. Crimes ranked severity many people affect badly affected harmed. First crimes serious deserving punishment. Second severe worse punishment finally worst crime RAPE OF A MOTHER, Second WORST CRIME IS RAPE OF A WOMEN. The comes murder. Now country know rape reported also prosecuted reported. But, Hobbesian world rape would prosecuted crime women word would held mans. Also Hobbes points crime committed small man serious crime committed great man. The reason great man, long crime committed property, better afford lose small man. Therefore since sovereign obligated protect ALL citizens must also ensure small man taken advantage great man. Again another point GOP ignored misinterpreted Leviathan. (Part II, CH XXVII, Paragraph 36 - 54) Lastly lets quickly look Taxes Private Armies. In taxes small man pay Great Man pay more. Again Great Man resources therefore paying tax affect much small man hurt unfair taxes.(Part II CH XXX Paragraph 17) As privatization Armies, plan U.S. DOD seems heading in. Private Armies tend become real forces inside country rather used Sovereign defense. And private Armies become powerful incumbent Sovereign dismantle NOT pose threat Nation Sovereign. A point DOD getting use extraordinary rendition privatization forces like Blackwell KBR.(Part II CH XXIX Paragraph 21) All small private force sprung since 9/11 need dismantled per Leviathan our, citizenry, safety. If Republican I've hard you, failing think critically given complaining. I would suggest actually read Leviathan The Bible cover cover audit classes held local University get educated view written. If Democrat also need . We need fight RT Wing extremists using words source documents. Many people know actually cite source level would barley acceptable Freshman writing course. (I know I cited sources acceptable MLA ACA format, quick (?) review 350 year old work I going bothered breaking MLA manual.) And confronted actual facts fold like cheap house cards. We must continually confront given critical thinking skills pundits, repeat RT Wing irrational thought, use foundation documents GOP uses regard actually say, tell actually said words I n red actually said foundation documents GOP abused.

John Wiswell,"Fascism treated like dirty word school thought days, interesting read book could lead it. Fascism system makes state government ultimate authority, Hobbes clearly unquestionable sovereigns - nearly every argument makes monarch work fascists.

He makes clear purpose sovereign state serve people, denies people right revolt even demand change government. His arguments exhaustive, tries best obey reason rather divine right corners, harkening concepts social contract anarchy (the horrors latter tamped modern society, much salient Europe).

His ultimate assessment human beings motivated fear, greed ego cynical possibly insulting, fair things shown caused almost every war corruption almost every government world history. In estimation philosophy, religion, money things vehicles true inspirations, I accept, personally I know I fear, greed egotistic impulses, though necessarily degree manner describes.

Tuncay Özdemir,"Hobbes'un bu kitabı İngiltere iç savaş yıllarındaki kaos döneminde yazdığı bilgisi önemli. Hobbes, devletin olmadığı doğa durumunda herkesin şeye hakkının olduğu, doğru yanlışın, adil adaletsizin bir anlamı olmadığını, bu durumdaki insan hayatının ise sefil kaba saba olduğunu, bunun da koyunun kendi bacağından asıldığı sürekli bir yalnızlık durumu olduğunu söylüyor. Bundan kurtulmanın tek yolu, bir yönetici ya da devletten koruma almak özgürlüklerinin bir kısmından vazgeçmek ona itaat etmek. Hatta bu itaat kısmını öyle abartıyor ki bugün ""leviathan"" terimi kollarını toplumun bütün parçalarına uzatan bir canavarı, devasa bir devleti açıklıyor. Hobbes'un bu felsefesinin totaliter bir devlete yol açacağı bana kalırsa aşikar ancak yine de bu kitap yazıldığı dönem için iki açıdan çok önemli. Birincisi kralların doğal bir üstünlüğe sahip olmayıp halklarının yazılı olmayan onayıyla gücü iktidarı ellerinde tuttuğunu savunarak tanrı ile kral arasında güne kadar süregelen bağlantıyı yıpratmış/koparmış olması. İkincisi ise Papa kilisenin bu cismani egemene üstün veya ondan ayrı değil, ona tabi hatta onun yetki izniyle ruhani iktidarı elinde bulunduran bir güç olduğunu belirtmesi. İlk yönüyle modern devletin Locke ile gelişecek temelini, diğer yönüyle de devlet kontrolünde bir din anlayışını içeren bir laikliği görüyoruz. (Türkiye'dekine çok benzer)","212 reviews

Those roundly condemn Hobbes progenitor totalitarianism overlook one significant philosophical works Western history, book whose reinvention concepts reason, sovereignty, right, liberty remains commonplace today. It wonder premier historians Quentin Skinner, Richard Tuck, Noel Malcolm fascinated man. A brief aside I describe book itself, Hobbes usually remembered one book, accomplishments range widely beyond Leviathan. Hobbes heavily engaged scientific discourse time wrote conducted experiments widely physics, chemistry, optics. Hobbes fluent German, Italian, Latin, Greek, created authoritative translations Thucydides Homer. Additionally, first Englishman engage humanist biblical criticism employs hermeneutical methodologies. To fair, able develop expert-level contributions fields far flung physiology mathematics lived age 91 twice life expectancy, arguably possesses impressive resume seventeenth century.

At one point openly declared superior mathematics scholars Oxford put together, began rather amusing war words university (which reason felt need respond challenge) really skilled. But get Leviathan. Even West wholly condemns absolutism many Hobbesian political arguments, still fascinating extent ideas become firmament subsequent Western discourse built. For example, argues human beings fundamentally creatures directed toward self-preservation must use reason calculate means toward end also balancing desires passions. Within sentence find traces Rousseau, Adam Smith, Darwin, et al. (Max Weber's concept instrumental reason arguably emerges Hobbes). Other familiar assertions emerge throughout Leviathan. While commonplace assumptions now, novel time. -All men created equal (ch. 13) -Liberty absence external impediments one's desire (ch. 14) -The commonwealth created gathering people elect sovereign popular vote majority confers right authority onto person sovereign (ch. 18) Hobbes develops sophisticated system develop political thought, defining concepts like sovereignty, representation, person would crucial development democracy. Furthermore, introduces understanding abstract person stand another individual group people. While hardly seems novel, understanding legal representation proxy would lay foundations corporate law especially elaboration private systems companies count legal persons. (David Armitage also points Hobbes' legal philosophy laid foundations international law well.) The sheer thoroughness rigor Hobbes' argumentation astounding. Inspired Euclid's Elements, Hobbes applied deductive method political philosophy, results undoubtedly impressive. But merely work political philosophy, would account 200 500 pages comprise mammoth tome. Throughout second half book, Hobbes dives thorough biblical theological analysis, sheer effort exerted proclaiming supremacy Christ kingdom call claims Hobbes atheist question. Hobbes explores validity canon, analyzes key theological concepts using astonishingly thorough biblical cross-referencing, touches upon theological debates ranging soteriology sacramentology demonology ecclesiology. Partway chapter 46, Hobbes also decides begin point-by-point refutation Aristotle's pihlosophy provides extensive arguments Aristotle's theory logic, metaphysics, physics, psychology, politics. He unpacks extent Aristotelian pagan traditions infiltrated Roman Catholic tradition (while also weighing contemporary Catholic debates conciliarist discussions authority Pope bishops). He ends drawing extended comparison Roman Catholicism Kingdom Fairies often described old wives' tales. (While also dense, Hobbes' prose rife witty sarcasm, savage burns, small degree humor.) I'll also conclude review quoting rewarding end book: ""The Fairies seized on; brought answer hurt do. So also Ecclesiastiques vanish away Tribunals Civill Justice. [...] When Fairies displeased body, said send Elves, pinch them. The Ecclesiastiques, displeased Civill State, make also Elves, is, Superstitious, Enchanted Subjects, pinch Princes [...] To this, like resemblances Papacy, Kingdom Fairies, may added this, Fairies existence, Fancies ignorant people, rising Traditions old wives, old Poets; Spirituall Power Pope consisteth onely Fear Seduced people stand in, Excommunication; upon hearing false Miracles, false Traditions, false Interpretations Scripture."" Such multivalent masterpiece Leviathan undoubtedly great blessing literature Western tradition, even ideas concepts built numerous problems foundations modernity.","141 reviews

ELLE,"Hobbes inizia la sua riflessione da un’ipotesi estrema: natura c’è una moltitudine di individui, privi di qualunque legame tra di loro. Il conflitto nasce virtù del fatto che quando un individuo sfrutta una possibilità, ne priva qualcun altro: il cosmo, infatti, non è grado di soddisfare il desiderio di tutti perché le risorse non sono illimitate. È da qui che nasce il conflitto. In altre parole, egli parte dall’idea che natura c’è una moltitudine di individui uguali, con le stesse capacità. Ed è proprio virtù di questa uguaglianza, da questo jus naturale – diritto di natura, ossia “la libertà che ciascuno possiede di usare il proprio potere nel senso che vuole, allo scopo di preservare la propria natura, cioè la sua vita, e conseguentemente di fare qualunque cosa che, secondo il giudizio e la ragione, gli sembra essere il mezzo più adatto realizzare quel fine”, il diritto di tutti tutto – che si origina il conflitto endemico, la guerra di tutti contro tutti, poiché ognuno ha, per natura, diritto ad ogni cosa.",14 reviews,Rating 3 out of 5,1 like,it,0.103,0.783,0.114,-0.0444,neutral

Anto Pujol,"El libro está dividido en cuatro partes: I. Del hombre. Ocupa el 75% del libro. Me imagino Hobbes como un señor mayor acurrucado delante de su chimenea refunfuñando de todo, sentando cátedra de cómo son las cosas, que todo aquél que siga su método esté de acuerdo con sus conclusiones es porque está alejado de la verdad. Sí que hay alguna cosa que ha gustado: ""En todas vuestras acciones, considerad frecuentemente aquello que queréis poseer, porque es la cosa que dirige todos vuestros pensamientos al camino para alcanzarlo."" ""El valor estimación del hombre es, como el de todas las demás cosas, su precio; es decir, tanto como sería dado por el uso del poder. Por consiguiente, es absoluto sino una consencuencia de la necesidad del jucio de otro."" Habla de algunos conceptos: el derecho de naturaleza, que es la libertad de cada hombre de usar su propio poder como quiera, para la conservación de su propia naturaleza (su propia vida); la libertad, que se entiende como ausencia de impedimento externos; la ley de la naturaleza, que es lo que impide un hombre hacer lo que puede destruir su vida privarle de los medios de conservarla, bien omitir aquello mediante lo cual piensa que pueda quedar su vida mejor preservada. A partir de ahí, dice que ""cada hombre tiene derecho hacer cualquier cosa, incluso en el cuerpo de los demás. Y, por consiguiente, mientras persiste ese derecho natural de cada uno con respecto todas las cosas, puede haber seguridad para nadie de existir durante todo el tiempo que ordinariamente la Naturaleza permite vivir los hombres."" por lo que cada hombre tiene que esforzarse por la paz, si lo consigue, pues la guerra. ""La definición de injusticiano es otra sino esta: el incumplimiento de un pacto"". Da mucha importancia al contrato/promesa/pacto como base de las relaciones humanas. Pero nos engañemos, que el pacto se mantiene porque somos buenesitos, sino que los pactos se mantiene por la amenaza de las armas. II. Del Estado. Junto con la parte final de la parte anterior, esta la parte más interesante del libro. Se parece mucho al Príncipe de Maquiavelo. Militarista, monárquico religioso. En esta parte sobre todo destaca la parte de monárquico militarista. ""Siendo indivisible esta gran autoridad, yendo inseparablemente aneja la soberanía, existe poca razón para la opinión de quienes dicen que aunque los reyes soberanos sean singulis maiores, sea, de mayor poder que cualquiera de sus súbditos, son universis minores, es decir, de menor poder que todos ellos juntos."" Me recuerda al Juramento de les reyes aragoneses: ""Nos, que somos valemos tanto como vos, pero juntos más que vos, os hacemos Principal, Rey Señor entre los iguales, con tal que guardéis nuestros fueros libertades; si no, no”. Aunque le quita un poco la gracia de que el Rey es elegido por dios que por eso lo votamos. ""Si un súbdito tiene una controversia con su soberano acerca de una deuda, del derecho de poseer tierras, bienes, acerca de cualqueir servicio requerido de sus manos, respecto cualquier pena corporal pecuniaria fundada en una ley procedente, el súbdito tiene la misma libertad para defender su derecho como si su antagonista fuera otro súbdito, puede realizar esa defensa ante los jueces designados por el soberano."" Parece bastante poco absolutista, pero que el Rey elija los jueces jeje. III. De un estado cristiano. Sin más. IV. Del reino de las tinieblas. Es un poco clickbait del siglo XVII. ""Lo que ofende los individuos es que estén gobernados como cada uno de ellos desearía por si mismo, sino como considera adecuado el representante público, ya sea un hombre una asamblea de hombres, es decir, por un gobierno arbitrario: por ello dan nombres desagradables su ssuperiores ignorando (hasta acaso un poco después de una guerra civil) que sin tal gobierno arbitrario semejante estado de guerra será perpetuo que es el hombres sus armas, las palabras las promesas, lo que afirma la fortaleza el poder de las leyes"". El libro termina de una forma que esperaba: ""haced que sean silenciados también castigados los maestros en virtud del poder de aquel quien está encomendada la tutela de la tranquilidad pública, es decir, por la autoridad civil: porque cualquier género de potestad que lo eclesiásticos asuman (en algún lugar donde estén sujetos al Estado) en su propio derecho, aunque lo denominen derecho divino, es sino usurpación. Todo el libro pensando que es un señoro absolutista monárquico cristiano para que al final dé cuenta de que durante todo momento estaba haciendo una distinción entre el poder religioso el poder civil. Podría volver leerlo con esta otra perspectiva, pero ape. No sé si terminado de cuadrar por dónde va Hobbes en todo momento. Ha sido bastante pesado pero por lo menos el libro es muy largo. PS: se llama Leviatán porque ""Hecho esto, la multitud así única en una persona se denomina Estado, en latín Civitas. Esta es la generación de aquel gran Leviatán, más bien (hablando con más reverencia) de aquel dios mortal, al cual debemos, bajo el Dios inmortal, nuestra paz nuestra defensa, porque en virtud de esta autoridad que se confiere por cad hombre particular el Estado posee utilizar anto poder fortaleza que por el terror que inspira es capaz de conformar las voluntades de tdoso ellos para la paz en su propio país, para la mutua ayuda contra sus enemigos en el extranjero.""

Alexander,"Three stars Leviathan, five stars Leviathan teeth skeptical response succeeding four centuries. Uprooted context, Hobbes’ treatise mostly dry, taxing, moribund dungeon-crawl musty precincts Christian Monarchism (though game-mechanics playing Commonwealth flexible enough democratic Assembly, clinching book’s rep cobwebbed grandfather clock modern political theory). Walking crypts vaults, past derelict waxworks political theology gone seed, churchy old-man-smell smug pedantry dyspeptic griping, book bores far often captivates, book one tempted finish earn “Yeah I read f*** it” merit badge, final installment (Book IV: “Of The Kingdome Darknesse”) becomes peculiarly entrancing, even uproarious. For context, Hobbes gamechanger apostate, burr sock royalist liberal, knotty disparate reasons. Stirred terror English Civil War, mirrors said conflict Jekyll-Hyde upheaval Mechanism vs. Revelation. Though author hardly unbeliever, God seem active, intercessory force (post-biblical) world, rather divine author natural laws undergird materialist psychology. This shocking disconnect helped blackball Hobbes untrustworthy cynic infidel, peppering treatise odd amusing vindications scriptural nuttiness. See example Chap. 37, “Of Miracles, use”, wacktastic showdown 7-8: Pharaoh’s elite necromancers go toe-with-toe Yahweh Hogwartsy wizard’s duel. Hobbes suspects Egyptian counterstrikes blockbuster feats sneaky, non-magical special FX! “If therefore Enchantment not, many think it, working strange effects spells, words, Imposture, delusion wrought ordinary means; far supernaturall operation, Impostors need study much naturall causes, ordinary ignorance, stupidity, superstition mankind, them; texts seem countenance power Magick, Witchcraft, Enchantment must needs another sense, first sight seem bear.” In later chapter, “Of Spirituall Darknesse,” buckshot cracks anti-Papist boom-stick, comparing Bread Wine transubstantiation “Onyons Leeks” Moses-era Egyptian alchemists. By chapter 47, “Of Benefit proceedeth Darknesse, accreweth,” Hobbes’ smirky blitzkrieg trolling rebukes Roman ecclesiastical mafia “Kingdome Fairies” (not typo, actually calls Fairies) who’ve grifted flock string devious power-grabs, largely rolled back Henry VIII Elizabeth I (Hobbes’ viagra boner Monarchy inexorable). The riffing ensues George Carlinesque I excerpt full end review. Cynical realism huffing cylinders came easy Hobbes, prevailing vision “the natural state Man” ego-blitzed pandemonium All All... …which fatally misjudges groupish, social, tribal instincts… …though overstuffed evidence-locker history, there’s enough sectarian mass murder make -caliber statism sound like lesser evil 17th-century ears. (The dictatorship Saddam Hussein criminal oppressive, dissent could land torture chamber, probability family member torn meat-confetti car-bomb shrapnel farmer’s market close zero.) Hanging another bullseye back, Hobbes considered doctrines Hell Purgatory spurious unfounded (angels, spirits, devils also get tossed FAIL chute), concluded theology bend knee civil power, preempt scorched-earth cycles religious civil war. This led argue Britain invaded by, say, Mujahideen armada, His Majesty’s Isles annexed Caliphate, Christian martyrdom may deferred, civic loyalty shifted, new Mahometan overlord, without tremor conscience.(!) Of course, fealty Christ would passionately maintained, inwardly, true believers could cash wad Skee-Ball tickets afterlife, greater worldly good stable hegemony, conquered Britains may turn cheek accept Sharia civil law, lack stomach emulate savior’s bloodletting. Though Hobbes stark realist here, probably envision train thought made critics’ heads explode. Why “bide one’s time” new sovereign vulnerable coup? Well, reasoned, might perpetuate endless tit-for-tat Hatfield-McCoy blood vendettas would make elevator scene look like pinky-finger cholesterol test. Besides, Apostolic Fathers never tried supplant Claudius Nero, Kingdom world. In Hobbes’ moral cosmos, monarch fails primary duty protect subjects, social contract dookie paper. Democracy contends virtuous stewardship curdle tyranny without checks-and-balances power, inflaming sedition undermining core argument Kingship – pacifism, order, unity. The monarchist would fire back “checks-and-balances” lead crippling policy gridlock grievously-underinformed electorate polarized hate -- frothy ecstasies righteous indignation divide conquer within. (Though bemoaning “the failures democracy” seems enduring feature democratic life, eras.) More perplexing still, ’s alleged Absolutism seeded precursory notions individual rights, government consent governed, natural equality men, planting memes would help downgrade “the Sovereign” tabloid fodder centuries on. Today’s reader may squint see tiny buds dimpling rooty topsoil, they’re there, several revolutions later, we’re here. ’s worldweary apology despotic collectivism carries destruct codes eventual dissolution.

Jacques Coulardeau,"I consider chapters approach. The priori position God origin everything, Bible absolutely true history humanity “creation” best order dictated God’s law order man free subjects situations ruled regulated God himself. This represents situation England 1651 absolute rule Puritans led Oliver Cromwell named Commonwealth. But value modern human beings come get ideas espouses religious axiom like pillory thinking. The introduction takes us directly subject. The general idea states man central element thinking man positioned nature. We clarify means nature later on. The idea man organism, architectural construction basis construction develops man, developed man. He thus identifies calls Leviathan, common-wealth state, built model body concept “sovereignty” stated “artificial soul.” This metaphor, metaphor, even densified comparing Leviathan created man simple machine watch clock, hence complex mechanism created man too. When bring concept God creator man image feel contradiction. Man creates Leviathan watch image, God’s, though man model creations speaking image God, hence Leviathan image image God. Yet Hobbes divides discourse nature governs govern us daily life, man civil dimension organizes common-wealth peace prosperity, God religious principles govern ultimate human society morality. We impression God something added previous two levels nature man sort wrapping reminds us creative dimension God superior ethical dimension God. But whole discourse reality nature civil society organized common-wealth state. In fact, could consider approach modern set aside divine supplement see man extending body capabilities everything creates. In fact basic concept “extensions man” developed Marshall McLuhan. I consider chapter 4 deals Speech. His starting point printing tremendous invention. He totally neglects tremendous impact education levels social life, religion, politics, culture, many others. This surprising since book intervention field politics ethics bound impact due number copies going circulated. But instead seeing caused printing press, goes back time (a typical unscientific retrospective method) considers invention writing lot important printing. He traces alphabetical writing back Phoenicians, false indeed, though invention writing per se since non alphabetical writing systems one. This Phoenician invention reached us Greek alphabet. He good point Homo Sapiens started emerging 300,000 years ago writing invented something like little bit 5,000 years ago. He right speaks isolating sounds speech represent letters become kind conceptual written forms isolated sounds. We root modern phonemics phonetics. He surprising fact still goes back speech, oral speech. He sticks idea speech incentive energy given Adam God though God gave Adam mission naming everything, considers speech invention “the noble profitable invention.” In spite referring Babel Tower myth, clearly states speech invention man using “tongue, Palat, lips, organs speech” produce it, though God real “author speech.” The objective “register thoughts.” We see modern way since connects speech body though ignores larynx elements body developed speech bipedal long distance fast running. What important sees organs names organs speech implying developed produce speech, case all. At time speech used man register thoughts sure thoughts come from? And process words sentences syntactic paradigmatic architectures produced? It quite obvious reference God Babel Tower myth nothing necessary reference society fact God author speech man inventor shows get God say necessity common-wealth permit survival species requires kind communication man uses physiological resources produce invent language, speech want. The “author” necessary social dimension man’s life survival emerging several hundred thousand years ago. That’s could call “Law Nature” going see. God name glued I wonder opportunistic really believed. He modern uses language: register past present thoughts, findings acquisition arts (old meaning crafts artistic productions); communicate knowledge others; give orders instructions; pleasure. His conception speech centered “names”, “proper” “common universal.” And reduces (“wise” “foolish”) meaning words use, neglecting fact mind (what are, wise foolish) like language, developed experience, experience invention use language develops way process. For names designate things, material sensible rational, hot cold, moving quiet. Then indicate accidents qualities perceive things, concrete abstract. And done properties body. The eyes gives sight perceives color becomes idea fancy considered thing. The ears give hearing perceives sound becomes idea, fancy conception it, noise music. His approach interpretative genetic. The final use names, hence speech, meta-language describing language itself. As says names “general, universal, special equivocal” speeches “an affirmation, interrogation, commandment; narration; syllogism, sermon, oration many others.” Here “speech” means either utterance (sentence) discourse one several sentences. He even concludes names “inconstant” reflect moods states mind speaker. All modern, refuses frozen congealed language connected circumstantial use, though dialectic would state mind language develop together one other, one development mind causing one development language vice versa. The approach utilitarian: use language for. That’s consider abuses language one particular type use nothing else since basic abuses language say something lie, hence true, aggress insult people. If turn chapters 14 15 come “Laws Nature” fact central piece book. Let list comment. First defines “right nature” fact individual right anything needs order defend life. This survival instinct exclusively level individual. This important see fact species per se survival instinct human beings cannot survive species organize life collectively. In words misses concept survival instinct. Then define concept “liberty” “the absence external impediments” purely negative definition going show impediments natural, implying liberty, conclusion would absolutely refuse. He define concept “law” opposes “right.” A law gives obligation him, whereas right liberty him. It sounds weird since right also established society laws regulations. He misses history imposes onto people limitations opens people possible actions, hence duties (have do) rights (can may do). But said consider laws nature consideration nature implies organization man’s life. 1- The first law nature every man needs peace otherwise constant state war individual survival (one all). 2- The second law nature reciprocal limitation “the right things” ensure peace. This calls covenant religious reference behind though covenants purely human way divine. It simple observation human beings ALWAYS live groups various types even individuals live absolutely alone reference groups move away from. 3- The third law nature men perform covenants. He comes simple definition “just” (what respects covenants) “unjust” (what goes covenants). Justice keeping covenants, hence therefore rule reason. He states though must coercive power compel men equally perform covenants. That concept common-wealth appears. 4- The fourth law nature gratitude. 5- The fifth law nature natural accommodation complaisance. 6- The sixth law nature facility pardon. 7- The seventh law nature revenges man must respect future good. 8- The eighth law nature men’s contumely contempt one another. 9- The ninth law nature pride. 10- The tenth law nature arrogance. 11- The eleventh law nature equity, proceed equally dealing various men. 12- The twelfth law nature equal use things common all. 13- The thirteenth law nature “lot,” i.e. priority anything first possession possessor. 14- The fourteenth law nature Primogeniture first seizing. 15- The fifteenth law nature mediators. 16- The sixteenth law nature one’s submission arbitrament arbitrators. 17- The seventeenth law nature fact man judge 18- The eighteenth law nature No man judge cause partiality. 19- The nineteenth law nature witnesses supposed numerous possible. Hobbes adds twentieth law nature concluding remarks: 20- The twentieth law nature ""that every man bound Nature, much lieth, protect Warre, Authority, protected time Peace."" It strange states clearly existing authority cannot changed everyone supposed defend attacked. This full contradiction Puritan revolution attacked Authority King, though object represented authority Parliament attack King, Civil war necessary since supporters authority natural obligation fight it. What’s implies Puritan Common-wealth cannot changed people fight attempt done change it. Historically principle de facto unacceptable. The restoration took place later Glorious Revolution took place Jacobites declared illegal traitors. We point laws nature based individualistic considerations. They laws nature governing every individual social political facts consequences first principle. The second remark deeply anti-historical. If laws nature basic covenant human commonwealths, respecting implementing covenant basis justice finally “the laws justice eternal,” meaning laws devised application continuation twenty laws nature, essence covenant basis justice, possible historical change, absurd. He even goes declares “the science laws true moral philosophy.” Such laws science. They reasoning, hence best theory. True enough dealing ethics nothing else ethics cannot “true” depend many personal choices nothing truth, except true one particular moment one particular situation one particular person. And even one ethical elements instated basic human right, example right enter sex alliance, marriage not, one forced it: basic human right choose implement themselves. In words gay marriage becoming compulsory everyone considered today basic human right. Note way plain marriage type compulsory either though basic human right. Then discussion “liberty” reveals lot philosophy. 1- For liberty purely individualistic. 2- For liberty defined negatively: absence opposition, “not hindered do.” Note “he” pronoun also meaningful: consider women, consider blacks (who slaves colonies), Indians (who slaughtered already colonies) even Irish ruthlessly colonized) probably like Catholics, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus. 3- For based fear law incentive liberty, since liberty necessity consistent comes basic religious fundamentalism: man God wants man God want do, beyond two obligations (to do) man may covered included. 4- When dealing “liberty subjects” see contradiction “liberty” “subject” (someone subjected another, submits authority another), even asserts “the liberty sovereigns.” The important liberty asserts liberty man defend body body’s integrity. This Habeas Corpus principle passed Parliament 1679. For liberty subjects silence law. This asserts power Judicature. This premise become Montesquieu judicial power. But understand works: tried first level lower court. You appeal appeal court. You finally appeal “supreme court” (House Lords England, Supreme Court USA) decision edict total ban one activity, total freedom practice it, in-between regulated practice. The best example abortion US Supreme Court made history fifty states ruling attempt reduce right abort women Texas. (SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, Syllabus: WHOLE WOMAN’S HEALTH ET AL. v. HELLERSTEDT, COMMISSIONER, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES, ET AL, CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT No. 15–274, Argued March 2, 2016—Decided June 27, 2016. , accessed August 19, 2016) 5- He concludes book call leniency Censors since “there nothing whole Discourse, far I perceive, contrary either Word God, good Manners; disturbance Publique Tranquillity. Therefore I think may profitably printed, profitably taught Universities.” This book essential prove historicity concepts “liberty,” “common-wealth,” including I consider like “democracy,” “monarchy,” “aristocracy,” tyranny,” “oligarchy” direct political field. In England per se see principles becoming established: distance purely fundamentalist religious approach, idea state organization social organization results covenants (what J.J. Rousseau call one century later “social contracts”), idea covenant result general historical rules govern survival human species, human group human individual, finally idea human activities governed ability man speak, communicate, imagine create crafts, arts, sciences. We could add religion probably came belief supernatural higher level determinism soon Homo Sapiens developed language enabled start trip road conceptualization. We are, within Puritan Common-wealth, real round history. There several roads emerging front us choices free determined context. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU","Author

Fraser Kinnear,"Long, long, long, long, long. For important work Political Philosophy, would nice Hobbes applied economy writing. I could get halfway Leviathan, I’m still proud of, still meant 400 pages traversal. As would expected, chapters numbingly dull thoroughness (3 chapters devoted entirely definitions common words phrases!!!) However, I really loved, as: Ch 13: Has famous “…nasty, brutish, short” line, follows fantastic point basically goes “You don’t believe me? Why lock door night?” Ch 14: Wherein Hobbes defines “Law Nature” that’s core idea book. Our natures seek individual liberties, conflict others’ liberties create “condition Warre every one every one”. We must overcome natures following first Law Nature “” second Law Nature “”. Funny many philosophers basically repackage Golden Rule. Ch 21: Wherein Hobbes defines explains scope Liberty. He shows proto-Libertarian ideas, specifically scope law “As Lyberties, depend silence Law. In cases Soveraign prescribed rule, Subject hath liberty so, forbeare, according discretion.” There’s wonderful, albeit commonplace, lines human nature. For example, one we’d call today open-mindedness: And despite Christian, there’s interesting criticisms religious behavior: Hobbes’ means organizing people ensuring give liberty form “Leviathan” (which collective individual) ultimate authority. Most exploration roles constraints around entity. Sometimes, Hobbes espouses sacrifice rights would never accept today, example freedom speech: Other chapters provide context Hobbes’s biases. He survived English Civil War mid-1600’s… I’m sure everyone happy sacrifice freedom peace. Political philosophy aside, Hobbes strangely prescient ideas later embraced. For example, line seems predict Analytical Philosophy: “Out may define, (that say determine,) is, meant word <, wee reckon amongst Faculties mind. For REASON, sense, nothing (that is, Adding Subtracting) Consequences generall names agreed upon, thoughts.” Or lines, read similar contemporary ways explaining unbounded finite universes: “When say thing infinite, signifie onely, able conceive ends, bounds thing named; Conception thing, inability” Or many descriptions throughout science, probably come surprise, Hobbes worked Francis Bacon youth.","774 reviews

Padmanabha Reddy,"A long book, lot lessons, wisdom politics, book contains almost everything one would desire for. Written English Civil War ripped nation apart published monarchy restored England, book never controversy. So much Hobbes blamed blasphemy found guilty Great Fire London 1666. Hobbes fierce defender royalists leave country Charles I executed parliamentary forces English Civil war. Hobbes wrote another book titled Behemoth considered scholars best work English civil war analyzed causes preventions civil war. The idea naming two greatest works “Behemoth” “Leviathan” comes Book Job Old testament. In many ways, book Leviathan considered greatest works laid foundations many political philosophers like John Locke Jean Jacques Rousseau give theories governments contracts. The book divided four distinct parts. The first part “Of Man” revolves around human psychology natural human condition. Hobbes materialist rejects existence angels aren’t looked upon materialistic manner. He also rejects Descartes called dualism separates body mind. The amount effort put Hobbes define every single aspect human life basic social elements like religion, quarrel, good governance. He goes formulate reason behind origin religion first place tells natural inquisitiveness humans also nature believe certain things let go tensions place religion born though makes distinction Christianity calls true religion others calls imaginary, He gives concept “The state nature” Locke Rousseau used create works treatises social contracts. He tells Leviathan humans normally social people get together personal gains like safety thus rejecting Aristotle's idea work Politics humans naturally social beings. In state nature, describes law self-preservation thus justice prevails person go extent save himself/herself. To get society order, people give liberty sovereign Hobbes names “Leviathan.” He explicitly also tells Leviathan person office. As original cover document rightly contains king holding scepter filled tiny people, Hobbes states sovereign gets authority people thus rejecting idea king divine representative God. This brings us second part book talks Natural law Laws nature gives us whole set rules justifies citing specific verses bible. The weirdest thing Hobbes gives importance rights duties. He also lays set rights sovereign end reading get know absolute. The idea absolutism prevalent strong Hobbes. But also lays limits powers sovereign interesting observation. One includes cannot harm people also removed office fails duties. The third part Leviathan “Of Christian Commonwealth” contains ideas justifications laid sovereign rule borders Christian world. Hobbes becomes bit radical considered scholars one reasons behind accusations Parliament. The last part “Kingdom Darkness” extensive attack Catholicism English time Protestants didn’t like all. For Hobbes tyrant gives power sovereign giving chance become tyrant. For others, one pro-democratic speakers gave importance rights duties. I would like end note saying Leviathan contain serious loopholes hand, classic, immortal piece document paved way greatest political treatises ever written.","Author

Do I agree politics fully utterly beholden facts human psychology? No. Was Hobbes' theory psychology dumb relevant modern context? Of course. But methodology incredibly thorough comprehensive use constructing vast encompassing political philosophy really something marvel at.

Paul,"Wide-ranging, perceptive, hard-nosed, book seeks establish basis legitimacy national governments, show us absolute arbitrary power sovereign, also necessary good. I came book one trained philosophy political science, one continuing work liberal education. So I roughest idea Hobbes's philosophy was, fit world political philosophy. I knew mainly author famous description condition man ""state nature"": Well. I guess call ""Chuckles"" Hobbes nothing. The state nature, Hobbes, state war every man every man. Each looks survival best can, protects depredations others best can. Everyone equal right everything world he, opinion, thinks might help aims, conflict arises men reason, final recourse except violence. Each issue resolved submission death weaker party conflict. Then hope bit peace next conflict. In state nature thing justice injustice; survival death. In this, seemed me, Hobbes describing behavior animals, state nature sees human animal different other. What make human animal different capacity reason language, which, together, enable understand world better animals, enter binding covenants others kind. Our reason permits us see peace prosperity depend people's willingness refrain molesting other, way realize condition except everyone involved make mutual covenant respect rule. But covenant alone enough; must enforced; task sovereignty group must placed hands one person, everyone must agree defer condition belonging. And thus state born. This ""social contract"" theory state, and, according Wikipedia, Hobbes originator theory. This sovereign, may assembly well individual, actually personates group: embodies power group. And source Hobbes's metaphorical title, commonwealth individuals compacted single great creature Leviathan, embodied sovereign. Whatever does, group, explicit implicit consent person it. When makes rules, making rules; punishes miscreants, punishing. It boils this: one complain anything sovereign does, everything sovereign done prior consent subject. If I object, I effect objecting will, absurdity. There kinds problems idea, I know Mortimer Adler, among many philosophers, rejected social-contract theory outright. But Hobbes, doubt conscious objections could raised idea, prepares case care depth. The first many surprises I got reading book discovering structure I opened table contents. The work divided four parts: Of Man Of Commonwealth Of Christian Commonwealth Of The Kingdom Darkness I surprised theological tone, I read book I discovered Hobbes was, among things, theologian, studied Bible deeply, drawn conclusions it. These conclusions key argument, question existence God all-important political philosopher kind thinker. Hobbes believed existence God discoverable human reason, specific God knowable revelation, vouchsafed certain individuals, made generally known via Bible. God's laws divided two classes: natural laws, discoverable reason; positive laws, encoded Bible. His natural laws apply everyone, positive laws given chosen people, Israelites, accepted sovereign Mount Sinai. At time every Israelite covenanted accept sovereignty God, thus bound accept God's commandments; covenant type social contract. Thus God King Jews repudiated time Saul, demanded earthly king kind nations, God acquiesced rejection him. Then Saul became sovereign, people bound kind covenant made God. One important consequences existence God political philosophy makes oaths binding. According Hobbes, oath atheist heathen worthless, atheist believe held account supreme cosmic power. He tempted renege suits him. The God-fearer, hand, expects face consequences bad faith, even human catches it. It's important point, oaths covenants made; covenant indispensable basis commonwealth. But seems practical matter theoretical one, Hobbes holds covenants binding, even state nature, due natural law. As far I understand recall, Hobbes believes natural reason perceive logic covenant, necessity remain unbroken. But I'm getting area I find obscure difficult. For Hobbes emphatic thing justice injustice commonwealth positive law given sovereign; then, breaking law injustice. And anything else whatever not. The principle covenants hold even state nature ""equity,"" boils Golden Rule. As far I make out, Hobbes saying break covenant state nature, violated equity, committed injustice. To seems like quibbling distinction, Hobbes big deal. Does mean valid commonwealth Christian commonwealth? Interestingly, no, not. For validity covenants applicable state nature, commonwealth equally valid civil entity. And Hobbes pains show God Old Testament, Jesus New, enjoined us obey worldly masters. Both natural reason Bible tell us render unto Caesar Caesar's. According Hobbes, owe unswerving even unquestioning allegiance civil power us, whatsoever may be. This sticks gorge, doubt almost every modern person. What would Hobbes made apartheid, Soviet Gulag, forms entrenched, ""legal"" injustice? His view whatever ""inconveniences"" one's existing commonwealth, preferable condition civil war, inevitable result rip sovereignty state. For civil war exactly condition divided sovereignty, inevitably produces great undeserved suffering. He may well point. Most us enjoy luxury lived civil war--a luxury Hobbes enjoy, since writing time English civil war, lived self-imposed exile 11 years. As far Hobbes concerned, always people complaints government; complaints never constitute reason overthrow government. The complainer underestimating benefit continually draws state: namely, protection criminal neighbors, protection invading armies. Taking protections granted, sets value, gravely mistaken. one thought-provoking books I read; Great Books copy heavily highlighted. Hobbes, devout Christian, also realist modern scientific outlook. His thinking rigorous uncompromising, takes great care work argument basic principles definitions. As intellectual achievement peers. Part discomfort book due sense many assertions, uncongenial even distressing, may difficult refute. Certainly, believe universe absolute Sovereign, hardly fundamental objection notion absolute sovereignty; Hobbes shows bowing sovereignty surely following God's will.","Author

Eric Althoff,"This supposed one great works political philosophy English language, yet I could think I plowed nearly 500 pages ""when end?""

All came precedent, course, certainly make compelling reading. Allow save hours reading summing Hobbes' philosophy: Human beings selfish creatures who, left unchecked, steal neighbors shit unless overarching power—let's call it, ""the government""—is stop them. It's cynical even standards man writing heights English Civil War, hey, harshest truths even stark. There, I've saved pain reading ""Leviathan."" For though axiom selfishness arguably famous passage human nature English language, padded hundreds pages parsing religious dogma, particularly Christianity Counter-reformation uneasy dance wake Henry VIII, founding Church England and, however brief, nascent English Republican, perished almost soon began wake war monarchists republicans. Four centuries on, England—er, United Kingdom—is one might call secular religious democracy, queen ostensibly head Church State wielding true power speak of. It Hobbes' day, religion politics linked, one needs understand least somewhat English Civil War which, thankfully, editor version ""Leviathan"" I read, blessedly willing provide. For backdrop ""Leviathan"" composed important author's theses. Indeed, looked hindsight nearly four centuries, amazing Hobbes hanged heresy, suggestions Heaven ""must"" part Earth not, much Christian philosophy posits, realm ""above"" beyond. In addition poly-sci, I suppose ""Leviathan"" belongs syllabi theological inquiry, much covers beyond me—and particularly interesting. Hobbes' bloviations politics religion could help intertwined given geopolitical realities day, modern reader, precisely ring relevant. Thus I much, much, much preferred ""The Prince"" Machiavelli, warnings—still relevant today—against arming lesser enemy avoiding hiring mercenaries. Words taken heart business, politics religion. But also stands Machiavelli's writing continues compelling, whereas Hobbes'—perhaps due mastery English also Latin, Greek French—feeling distant even charmingly naive read 21st century. Like I said, expect blown away. And also like I said, know lesson humans selfish creatures seek satisfy appetites unless power state—or tribe—nudges otherwise summed briskly. You need read all. The lessons there, sure, time precious. Rather, I leave Hobbes' best lessons...and I'll always appreciate, I suppose, leant name certain cartoon tiger.

Stone,"While likely attract enormous amount criticisms modern readers, Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan undoubtedly remarkable milestone history philosophy (and later political science). What Hobbes put forward book essentially reflection brand-new world marked laws mechanics discovered Galileo new fields horizons discovered (you dispute that, course) Columbus -- static, lackluster medieval world suddenly came thrilling end. While new ideas Rene Descartes Francis Bacon began move along dynamic earth, still slower motion -- Hobbes. The seemingly outrageous viewpoints (such state nature ""war every man every man"", eternal need ""sovereign"") Hobbes desperately set forth indeed, quite revolutionary groundbreaking mid 17th century book published. Note Hobbes believed , essentially challenged authority Christian God -- seemed one reason dedicated entire Book III ""Christian Commonwealth"" order distract attentions heretic inference one could easily derive Book I. More importantly, Hobbes royalist English Civil War work seem Royalty's benefit, nevertheless acknowledged validity overthrowing Sovereign favor another -- though best benefit collective people. As result, surprise book temporarily banned badly received people ends philosophical spectrum, Hobbes seemed pig-headed reformist zealot academia. Indeed, conclusions book painful comprehend, also language itself. Hobbes markedly huge fan Euclidean geometry applied geometrical methods proof virtually everything book -- practice unfound books contemporaries. While people formal logic training may find ease reading lengthy, geometry-styled inferences, readers would rather emancipate painfulness altogether. Hence another big reason Hobbes rather unpopular (seems still is) misunderstood. Reading alongside R. M. Ballantyne's , William Golding's , Daniel Defoe's provide nice interesting samples almost concepts Hobbes presented; moreover, natural assume Hobbes would direct confrontation anarchism, Peter Kropotkin's share amazingly amount similar conclusions -- another fascinating topic discussions. Last least, Lamarck Darwin's (including various sub-theories derived Darwinism) evolution theory would provide different angle looking Hobbes's -- really true state nature ""a war every man every man?"" Darwin would likely disagree Huxley hesitantly agrees.","190 reviews

Genni,"I would like give four stars, simply I find fascinating, honestly many glaring issues rating. However, I appreciate much second time around, especially learning English Civil War, I think necessary understanding Hobbes against. Most people probably aware Hobbes’ general ideas; men afraid lives, natural right defend lives, product suspicion right state war. In order peace, create governments absolutist. Hobbes never defines peace, interesting since argues definitions throughout book, deepest concern becomes apparent means absence war. I tend think people today would either define broadly, positively, would prioritize values quite point Hobbes does. Hobbes advocates absolute surrender government, preferred, stable government would monarchy. He thinks people throw term “tyranny” around loosely want governed. During English Civil War, many people fought different banners name religious conscious and, according Hobbes, cause chaos (which true, course Charles I without fault). Socrates would ideal subject Hobbes’ kingdom. When Crito offered break Socrates jail responds saying complained things going well could rebel pronounced him. However, proposes governments built individuals simultaneously consciously surrendering contract, obviously case almost government, plausible so. Hobbes firmer ground turns attention Christians begins argue surrender government Scripture. I wish Christians America would read section realize name God something entirely opposed Scripture teaches, I digress. Hobbes interesting arguments martyrdom. He states belief matter heart, Christians worry sovereign forces state believe. Consistent ontology civic philosophy laid parts 1 2, maintains responsibility case falls sovereign, Christian subject surrendered therefore bears guilt case. This introduction Hobbes’ different theological turns. I read phrase I think describes views perfectly: “unorthodox, unoriginal”. He maintains sort Christian materialism views hell strike reader modern. His views man nature somewhat similar found evolution.

Jason,"If real passion 17th century political theory book you. If not, may well skip it. Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan revolves around themes social contract, commonwealth, monarchy, theocracy. The main thrust goal human survival living peaceful existence since life wartime endangers people's safety, causing spend effort survival less leisure education. Wars shorten people's lives must prevented. The social contract means citizens must give rights exchange government protecting war. This social contract called ""commonwealth"" monarchical commonwealth effective democracy aristocracy latter two cause politicians constituents divide competing teams conflict other. Hence logical outcome war wars prevented absolute, totalitarian monarch divided himself. The best monarch acts according God's plans laid Bible. The book divided four sections though I think usefully divided two. The first two sections explain theory human nature, natural law, commonwealth monarchy. It essentially anatomy corporatist political system. The last two sections almost exclusively theology, especially Bible lends theocratic authoritarian monarchical rule. There also fair bit vitriolic condemnation Aristotle Pope. If Christian, I certainly not, second half tiring chore read. If political theory main interest skip quit end second section.

Other that, Hobbes makes three points work: 1) philosophers stupid, properly define words concepts, therefore misunderstand everything; 2) people naturally terrible, way escape constant state war enter consent others governed sovereign power; 3) entered consent governed sovereign power, sovereign power power, therefore monarchy best form government. Point one kind funny read notice it, point two recognizable form social contract number philosophers use. Something seems go wrong, however, points two three. If sovereign power authority consent people, people, individuals within people, suddenly longer power input? The authority power, according Hobbes, never overthrown revolted people gave consent. Well, people give consent? Simply born? What person give consent? Hobbes plows seems entirely logical: people still rights. His counter-argument sovereign power would never act way harm people, that's clearly ridiculous. When Hobbes takes argument ecclesiastical realm, church realm, similar problems, except says head church sovereign head civil government, church figure, 'the kingdom God' spiritual, end-of-time reality way present reality. That, course, suggests God Christ power life today, working way, except government. Put way, argument contradicts number scriptural passages Hobbes relies on, particularly passages Samuel regarding creation Israelite monarchy. God want work government. Umm, okay, then, Hobbes, dumb.

Gerardo,"Il testo è molto chiaro, ciononostante ci vuole molta pazienza per leggerlo tutto: non mi riferisco alla sua considerevole mole, tuttavia non più lunga di molti altri testi, per il fatto che il suo argomentare procede per accumulo e molto spesso ci si ritrova di fronte veri e propria elenchi. E' un testo notevole, perché cerca di distaccarsi dalla tradizione classica per fondare un modo di ragionare moderno, aprendo la strada alla filosofia successiva. Uno dei primi punti di interesse, dal punto di vista metodologico, è quello di partire da una riflessione sull'uomo e sul linguaggio: prima bisogna comprendere la natura del soggetto che pensa e acquisisce conoscenze, poi analizzare il come queste conoscenze possano essere espresse e condivise attraverso il linguaggio. In sostanza, il testo viene aperto da una riflessione sul come l'uomo conosca il mondo. Successivamente, si entra nel vivo del discorso e si parla dello Stato: lo Stato è una struttura sorta dall'accordo di uomini che sacrificando parte della propria libertà, la cedono un capo un'assemblea per essere difesi e amministrati. Infatti, ogni uomo, se non controllati da una terza parte (le Leggi e il Governo), faranno sempre prevalere la legge del più forte nei contenziosi due. Il Sovrano, poiché fonda la legge, non è soggetto ad essa: per questo, il suddito non può far altro che obbedire al sovrano, perché altrimenti metterebbe crisi il Governo e l'assenza di Governo, secondo Hobbes, è ben peggiore di qualsiasi altro stato di cose. L'ultima parte, quella più lunga, è una approfondita e logorroica disamina sul perché la Chiesa e il Papa non possano considerarsi al di sopra dei regnanti: sostanza, Hobbes afferma che tutti passi della Bibbia danno agli apostoli un ruolo di consiglieri, non di governanti, poiché questo ruolo spetta ad altri. Lo stesso Gesù non è un regnante di questa terra, poiché il suo regno ""non è di questo mondo"". L'ultimo capitolo, per tale motivo, è una critica al modo di governare della Chiesa, messa al pari del mondo delle Fate e dei Demoni, che pervertono la verità le sacre scritture. Per tutti coloro che vogliono andare alle origini del pensiero politico moderno.","477 reviews

Dean,"Recensione: http://thereadingpal.blogspot.it/2017... Il Leviatano è un testo che mi ha sempre attirato, non avevo particolare voglia di leggerlo. Filosofia non è proprio il mio ambito. Eppure... Hobbes si concentra sulla Politica e, particolare, nello Stato. Divide quindi il suo testo quattro sezioni: 1) Dell'Uomo, 2) Dello Stato, 3) Di uno Stato Cristiano e 4) Del Regno delle Tenebre. Per quanto mi riguarda, ho trovato piuttosto interessanti la prima e la seconda parte, mentre il mio interesse è abbastanza crollato sulla terza parte. In Dell'Uomo Hobbes si cimenta nella descrizione delle caratteristiche umana, come sensi, l'immaginazione, la parola. Inoltre parla anche di ragione e scienza, come anche di religione, nonché delle altre caratteristiche umane come le passioni. In questa prima parte ci chiarisce le leggi di Natura e le cause del naturale conflitto che c'è tra uomo e uomo. Interessante, no? Anche la seconda parte non delude: Hobbes ci parla di come si viene creare uno Stato, di cosa porta gli uomini ad abbandonare le loro caratteristiche naturali che li portano al conflitto, aderendo ad un patto con altri uomini, il cui fine primo sono la pace (che sostituisce la guerra dell'uomo natura) e la sicurezza. Ci parla quindi della figura del Sovrano e tutto ciò che riguarda lo Stato e sudditi. Questa è la parte che più mi interessava, personalmente. La terza parte, invece... Hobbes ci parla dello Stato Cristiano, e così facendo ci parla di Dio e tira fuori spezzoni dei testi sacri cristiani, che compongono la maggior parte di questa sezione. Mi sembrava di essere tornata fare catechismo, che già mi annoiava da piccola, figuriamoci ora. Nella quarta parte ci parla del nostro mondo corrente, che secondo lui è nel periodo del Regno delle Tenebre e, continuare la sezione precedente, ci dice che il regno di Dio non è ancora venuto. Pur essendo un testo corposo (e questa versione ha dei caratteri minuscoli), è interessante e tutto sommato sono contenta di averlo letto. Anche il saggio di Galli è piuttosto interessante, e la traduzione, correlata di note, ottima.","375 reviews

Gabriel Dametto,"Apesar de filósofo inglês Thomas Hobbes ter escrito Leviatã em meados séc. XVII, é impressionante como muitos conceitos e paradigmas se mantém relevantes até hoje, mesmo tendo em mente que sua teoria de um Estado centralizado e absoluto tenha sido eventualmente superada pelo liberalismo político-filosófico. O livro aborda natureza humana e relações sociais de maneira mecanicista e nominalista, valendo-se, também, de argumentos teístas-cristãos e da lógica física-empirista cartesiana, sob uma ótica contratualista, muito comum entre os pensadores da época. O filósofo disserta sobre Estado de natureza, que seria uma condição de guerra civil permanente de todos contra todos (Bellum omnia omnes) devido condição natural humana, advinda da igualdade e não seguimento das leis naturais. A fim de acabar com conflito, homem decide formar sociedade por meio de um pacto social, em que ele abdica da sua liberdade em prol de uma forma de poder soberana - um monarca ou uma assembleia -, com poderes totalitários. O Estado, ou Leviatã, autoridade inquestionável, por meio poder coercitivo da espada, e medo que dela decorre, pode, enfim, assegurar direito à propriedade e instituir leis civis, por exemplo, e, dessa forma, assegurar paz. Um aspecto pouco destacado da obra é sua importância para Direito: contratos, leis civis, herança, importância poder coercitivo da espada pelo Estado para manutenção da ordem e da atuação das normas jurídicas, sujeito de direito, pessoa de direito, formas de governo, soberania, liberdade e legitimidade são termos abordados e conceituados pelo livro, e muitas das suas significações permanecem de forma parcial Direito brasileiro contemporâneo, especialmente que consta Direito Estado e Direito Civil. Tais aspectos conferem ao livro um caráter perene, essencial para compreensão das instituições jurídicas históricas e atuais e ao pensamento filosófico moderno.","19 reviews

In words, according Hobbes, need Leviathan. One supposes Hobbes literate enough understand leviathan scripture sea monster commonly understood represent devil. My expectations little bit unrealized. Reading introduction, became clear people loved book people hate orthodox Christianity. That exaggeration.

He starts defining difference imagination perception difference dreams fantasy. From there, going, I'm sure I could tell. I can, however, give thumbnail sketch procedure, since kind enough throw start. The basic idea men (meaning people) nature artists create representational figures art. Government, I say society, nothing cooperative representation human being. Everything human accomplishes life, society accomplishes group - man made men. Therefore, determine exactly human - receives information world, adjusts makes successful - able extrapolate collections human beings do, coordinate society understand world collectively, adjust it, approach peak points culture.

If make society government identical other, rule possibility tyranny get-go. If problem anarchy always got somebody trampling weaker neighbor, can't solve insisting parties part collective group, ruled careful administrator. It always turns 'administrator' bears striking resemblance trampl rest group bears good deal resemblance trample. Governments society ever safe infinite regression parts society come together sufficient force tell government ""no!"" really make stick. If society government, government tyranny. In case watching, tyranny generally considered bad. The thing kept sticking Hobbes really hated Aristotle. Now, I've read bit Aristotle, I really kind like him. He really lot sticking power. The renaissance modern science made pretense overthrowing long while, starting look like 500 year fad. Aristotle says drop rock, falls instead floating rocks natural resting place, that, let go, drawn resting place nature. Einstein tells us mathematical clarity nothing kind: It's bodies enormous mass cause space curve objects mass drawn them. Which really another way saying exact thing. What mass, curvature space, except ""nature""? The progress we've made understanding natural world, part amounts nothing better engineering finer precision. The basic concepts surprisingly consistent. So also Hobbes. He apparently hated Aristotle, least approach scholastics day, put great deal emphasis Aristotle. But reading Hobbes, sounds great deal like Aristotle, proceeding kinds measures. But Aristotle might made appeal classical history, clear observations world everybody familiar time, Hobbes frequently makes reference science. Now Hobbes' science may quite good, maybe even groundbreaking day. I gathered introduction many think he's early modern precursor dozens modern fields study. But truth is, poor background modern science good deal clearer cleaner thorough background 16th century science. So even first chapter, Hobbes starts making observations sense perception based nature dreams, I'm rolling eyes two different levels (which difficult thing do), clear Hobbes know he's talking terms brain processes analyses sense information, also pretty evident part he's trying prove Aristotle too. At point reading, I gave up. A book many pages hook attention convince worth time go reading. Leviathan failed that. To mix metaphors fields I experience, I felt time would better spent someone spending less effort trying knock every ball park, trying move ball yards toward goal. He probably decent ideas here, worth effort go digging original. A well-written summary could probably trick less frustration.","8 reviews

Hobbes活了92岁经历了17世纪英国动荡的政权，作为一个政治学家也是挺牛的。The grand conclusion Hobbes’s analysis human nature men necessarily engaged incessant struggle power others (about man’s necessarily competitive search power).Hobbes认为人对死亡的恐惧是不言自明的。“Every man…shuns evil, chiefly chiefest natural evils, death; doth, certain impulsion nature, less whereby stone moves downwards.” Hobbes提出的主权社会其实本质上是资本主义社会，虽然他认为内战的罪魁祸首是新兴的资产阶级，而他的理想主权国家的最终目的是避免内战。Macpherson认为Hobbes对平等的执念阻止了他认清阶层分化和资产阶级作为一个阶层凝聚力的必然性。Hobbes认为个体对权利的竞争本性使得他们愿意诚服于主权社会/政府，从而获得对个人财产和安全的保护。 三百多年前的英语读起来比想象的容易一些，很多词拼法不同但很好猜，有些稍微难点，但多读几遍也猜出来了。比如Trayne train，perswasion persuasion. 当然也有些要查字典才知道啥意思（比如hearkened，devest）。后来听了另一本书才知道16世纪的英语已经是modern English了(from 400s 1066 Old English, 1066 1400s Middle English, 1400s onwards Modern English). 总体来说很枯燥，很多定义啥的（关于法律，联邦，基督教联邦，基督教教义等等）。本书在历史上的重要性并非仅仅源于结论（反对君权神授，主张专制主权国家）而是方法（首次把政治提升到科学的高度，从个体推论到政权）。 “Adherence Custome, ignorance nature Right Wrong…Which cause, doctrine Right Wrong, perpetually disputed, Pen Sword: whereas doctrines Lines, Figures, so; men care not, subject truth, thing crosses mans ambition, profit, lust.”",143 reviews,Rating 4 out of 5,None,en,0.182,0.639,0.179,0.128,positive

Kişiye birçok açıdan katkı sağlayacak bir metin olması sebebiyle açık fikirlilikle okunmasını tavsiye ederim. Bu açılardan iki tanesi şöyle ki; Bir argüman nasıl inşa edilir konusunda bir ders kitabı diyebilirim. Biçim itibariyle etkilenmemek elde değil. Politik kıvraklık nedir nasıl kullanılır konusunda yine çok başarılı. Kralının meşruluğunu sağlarken, Hristiyanlara Hristiyanlığa saygısızlık etmeden Papa'yı Kilise'yi harika eleştirmiş, hatta bildirmeye girişmiş. Bu girişim hemen sonuç verdi mi tarihsel olarak bilmiyorum ama bugüne baktığımda sonuç verdiğini görüyorum. Mutlak otoriteyi eleştirmek isteyen varsa buradan pekala ders alabilir. Beğenmediğim bir yanı da şudur; sanki sıfırdan başlayarak inşa ettiği devlet hukuk sistemi vardığı bir doğal sonuç değil de, zaten en baştan varmak istediği sonuç. Yani sıfırdan çıkarım yapıyor ya da bir dünya inşa ediyor gibi görünse de, niyeti zaten doğru olduğunu düşündüğü şeyi savunmak ya da meşrulaştırmak gibi geldi. Bu bağlamda yazar benim gözümde bir filozof olmaktan çok bir siyasetçi oldu.

Tarcísio Rocha,"É um livro que contém aspectos de um sistema filosófico, pois Hobbes fala de uma porção de assuntos com pretensão de concatená-los. É dividido em quatro partes: homem, da commonwealth, da christian commonwealth, reino nas trevas. Destacaria sua inspiração na geometria euclidiana e sua influência evidênte de Galileu Galilei; suas considerações nos capítulos iniciais sobre linguagem e pensamento, da natureza humana, e criação pacto social, também os capítulos 16 e 17 com dialética ator-autor. É uma das referências principais para pensar binômio natureza-cultura, já que Hobbes fornece uma reflexão sobre gênese Estado de Direito e sistema de representação político. As duas últimas partes achei especialmente cansativas, mas, talvez, por não conhecer algumas das referências e faltar com repertório suficiente para compreender os movimentos executados por Hobbes. No geral livro é escrito em uma linguagem bem clara, às vezes é um pouco repetitivo, mas nada que torne livro insuportável.","10 reviews

Eduardo Fort,"""Leviatán: la materia, forma poder de una república eclesiástica civil"" es solamente la obra magna del filósofo inglés Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), uno de los fundadores de la filosofía política moderna, sino también uno de los textos fundamentales de la Ciencia Política. Publicado en 1651, su título hace referencia al monstruo bíblico Leviatán, de poder descomunal. La obra de Hobbes, marcadamente materialista, puede entenderse como una justificación del Estado absoluto, la vez que como la proposición teórica del contrato social, establece una doctrina de derecho moderno como base de las sociedades de los gobiernos legítimos.","75 reviews

SJ Loria,"A haunting look government control human mind. It worth challenge bash heads Hobbes, smart man indeed. I know what's chilling, fact rationally lays arguments OR fact government society resemble Leviathan ways we'd like admit. One best terrifying political philosophy books ever written I AWESOME professor help lead one. Quotes: “The natural cause religion anxiety time come…all men much curious search causes good evil fortune…thinking anything beginning also cause…when cannot assure true causes things (for causes good evil fortune part invisible) supposes causes them.” 63 – What Hobbes saying things happen, yet people search greater cause. The role religion create notion greater cause purpose control behavior fear. The gods first created human fear. 64 Men pleasure, contrary great deal grief, keeping company power able over-awe all. 75 “Men live without common power keep awe, condition called war…every man every man….In conditions place industry, fruit uncertain, consequently, culture earth, navigation, use commodities may imported sea, commodious building…no knowledge face earth, account time, arts, letters, society, worst all, continual fear danger violent death life man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish short.” – A harsh perspective. Basically, life short pathetic, men must kept state awe something powerful themselves. War instrument keeping yours. Yikes. 76 “To war every man every man, also consequent: nothing unjust. The notions right wrong, justice injustice, place. Where common power, law; law, injustice.” 78 Essentially, ideas justice rights first off, ideas, secondly, predicated common power keep people check. It important power, rights silly notion rests foundation power fear. “The mutual transferring right men call contract…words alone, time come, contain bare promise, insufficient sign free gift, therefore obligatory.” 83 The idea living society government ensured peace liberty (which Hobbs defines ability move molecules brain, haha!) given rights. When born enter social contract (not sure first political philosopher dude conceive idea, one first). “The way erect common power may able defend invasion foreigners injuries one another, thereby secure them…reduce wills, pluarity voices, one will…to submit wills, everyone one will, judgments judgment. This consent, concord; real unity them…This done, multitude united one person called Commonwealth, Latin Civitas. This generation great Leviathan, rather (to speak reventely) Moral God owe, Immortal God, pace defense.” 109 Basically, Leviathan speaks protects every man, submit like god. It better unified protected whole otherwise we’d kill other. “Laws nature…are properly laws, qualities dispose men peace obedience…In differences private men, declare equity, justice, moral virtue, make binding, need ordinances sovereign power, punishments ordained shall break them, ordinances therefore part civil law.” 174 OK, laws meaningful backed power force. Notice laws nature dispose men peace obedience, insufficient, still violent creatures. He gets rather long defense force necessary best apply it. “For seeing ghostly power [Hobbes’ term religion] challenge right declare sin…the civil power challenging declare law, every subject must obey two masters, commands observed law, impossible…When two powers oppose one another, commonwealth cannot great danger civil war dissolution. For civil authority visible…cannot choose draw times considerable part people.” 216 If religion separate realm, it’s another power player best interest commonwealth. Rather, effective government incorporate religious realm.","437 reviews

Kaamos,"Avrupa siyaset anlayışında çok önemli değişimlerin yaşandığı bir dönemde, düşünce ayrımlarından doğan yönetimsel açıkların bunların topluma etkilerinin travmatik izlerini taşıyan; buna rağmen özellikle toplumu oluşturan bireyler/bir salt varlık olarak toplum yönetici/egemen kimlik arasında Hobbes'un tanımıyla bizi doğa kaos durumundan çıkartan pozitif yasalar aracılığıyla oluşan bir 'toplumsal sözleşme'ye atıflar yapan aynı zamanda bizzat dini tarihin öğretilerinden yararlanarak reformist diskuru sakınmadan devlet yönetimi ile dinî öğretilerin birbirlerinden ayrılığı gerekliliğine dikkat çeken bir eser. Siyaset bilimi, avrupa tarihi, siyaset felsefesi üzerine akademik araştırmalar gerçekleştirmiyor olduğumdan nitelikli bir araştırmacının metodolojisi ile yaklaşmadığımdan, zaman zaman nesnel bakış açımı eseri dönemi içerisinde değerlendirme gerekliliğine olan inancımı kaybetmeme sebebiyet verebilecek, kişisel görüş düşüncelerime son derece aykırı şekilde, genel anlamda oldukça pesimist bir yaklaşım içerisinde, insanın kendi özgür iradesi ile kendisini bir egemen altında uyruk kılmadığı (kendi iradesi ile özgürlüğünden -doğadaki halinden- vazgeçtiği bir sözleşmenin olmadığı) bir ortamda, ünlü deyişle 'insan, insanın kurdu' olduğu için, zaman bir savaş halinde olacağı, bu durumun uzun vadede insanlığı medeniyeti asla ileriye taşıyamayacak bir hal olduğunu, zaman zaman antik yunan felsefesine de sövgülerde bulunarak ateşli bir şekilde savunan bir yapıt. Bu noktada özellikle Hobbes'un literatüre sunmuş olduğu 'toplumsal sözleşme'den yararlanarak ileride 'vatandaşlık' kavramına kadar ulaşılacaktı belki de, ancak Hobbes, Leviathan içerisinde uyruğun, sözleşmeyi yapmış olduğu egemen ile onu seçtikten onayladıktan sonraki bütün bağlarını sadece bir koruma hayatta tutma ilişkisine dönüştürüyor. Ve taraflardan biri bu yetisini kaybettiğinde, sözleşme başka bir egemene nakledilebiliyor.

1.1,"Finally I get read Handbook Absolutism. My first thought being, I state, indeed modern ears, writing therof considerably archaic and, might added, due course also pompous. Yet, leads lots fun sentences wherein one find stunning multiplicity commas, subordinate clauses, go reading, even keep one's eyes focused, also one's eyelids open, doth feel chore. It also leads fun kind philosophical construction maketh one chuckle: Judge much, revered Hobbes? Imagine reading 30+ dense pages discussion jurisprudence judicature judgment. While I reading, sometimes meaning went words, reconnected pages bit rest eyes. To get way: I recommend book people all, scholars (who read it), philosophers (do still exist? read I might delight learning frustration), hidebound pedants (which, truth told, former two one body, commonwealth sorts). That said I enjoy Hobbes' reasonings would churlish admit wrote piece painstakingly, taking care explain everything reader, parts can't understand due remoteness time, chalked effects English Civil War anxieties relating that. In addition, reading I hoping final part, 'Of Kingdom Darkness', would treat, get I go tedious part of, I think, book I've ever read: ""Of Christian Commonwealth"" (and, perspective it: abandonment seems especially weak). But I got treated spectacularly reasoned raillery Papal Church and, finally, I smiled little, imagining Hobbes dude sweating French summer heat scribbling away storm amidst pile books, going one thing hates pagan tradition, disdains women: Church Rome... delightful. I picked bad time read book. Due generally busy, took 5 weeks get half way second part, I resolved read rest week managed it, mostly forcing go taking utmost pleasure passages well-constructed, forceful, interesting. There's lot learn book, now-outdated ideal Commonwealth also fine line political writers tread 17th century. Is archaic? Yes. Rightly important? Well, sure. It's definitely part canon western civilisation. It's tedious though. It's source 1 quote, literally 1 quote, that's often trotted out. No wonder. I suspect vast majority people speak Hobbesian state nature read whole book, they'd still struggling finish it. Still, nature vs civl that... good. Lots reason, things following reason, book: like that, it. You'll get real kick man's style. Ultimately book really got think individualism versus collectivism. In era sacrifice iota personal liberty save state, even many cases help homeless person, learn something, improve ourselves; governments mostly filled people detached, checked-out, exploited (or exploiting, beyond civil servants), untrustworthy, venal give willingly them, Hobbes' ideal state individual commonwealth, would totally irrational. It would interesting Hobbes resurrected rewrote book era, after, say, 10 years intense study it, see would changed 17th century. One major benefit reading book that, weeks least, basically everything seem like extremely light pleasant fare (my return fiction biography glorious). Sometimes, honest: I barely enjoyed reading book, please note: I pun name review. But I'll read 'Behemoth' I ever find it, though I go searching time soon. I'll leave one lovely quote Hobbes man himself, still makes sense, still rings true, still sounds pretty good sense:","421 reviews

ArEzO.... Es,این اثر دارای چهار بخش است: «انسان»، «دولت»، «دولت مسیحی»، و «قلمرو ظلمات» به عنوان ضد دولت مسیحی. نخستین بخش خلاصه‌ای از مقدمات فلسفی است که در دو اثر دیگر هابز جسم و طبیعت انسانی، به تفصیل آمده است. برابر این مقدمات وجودشناختی، فقط اجسام وجود دارند که ممکن است اجسام مادی به معنای دقیق کلمه (یا طبیعی) و اجسام سیاسی (مصنوعی) باشند. از سویی، انسان بخشی از ماده است و از آن تشکیل شده است و از سوی دیگر، به عنوان موجودی که می‌تواند اجسام مصنوعی به وجود آورد سازنده و فاعل نظریه سیاسی است. شناختها مجموعه احساسهاست که به نوبه خود دگرگونیها، یعنی حرکاتی است که در اجسام محسوس ایجاد شده و به وسیله اعصاب به مغز انتقال یافته است. ادراکات ما از جهان احساس دگرگونیهای مربوطی است که در جوهر دماغی وارد می‌شود و بنابراین، این ادراکات اموری ذهنی‌اند. غریزه‌های غلبه‌ناپذیری تعیین‌کننده دقیق همه اعمال انسان‌اند. در اعمال انسان جایی برای آزادی وجود ندارد و خیر و شر اموری نسبی‌اند: خیر با مطلوب و شر با نامطلوب یگانه است. نتیجه منطقی این مادی مذهبی نظریه «دولت مطلقه» است. در نظر هابز، در موضوع سیاست، آزادی به اندازه اخلاق و متافیزیک غیرقابل قبول است: در دولت، همچنان که در طبیعت، قدرت موجد حق است. حالت طبیعی انسانها «جنگ همه با همه است»، و دولت وسیله ضروری پایان بخشیدن به این حالت است. دولتْ زندگی و اموال افراد را به بهای اطاعت منفعلانه و مطلقی که از آنها انتظار دارد مورد حمایت قرار می‌دهد. امر دولت خیر است و نهی دولت شر؛ اراده دولت عالی‌ترین قانون است. هابز به این موجود مصنوعی که دولت یا جمهوری را به وجود می‌آورد –یعنی آدمکی حقیقی که دارای زندگی صرفاً ماشینی است و نبوغ انسانی آن را طرح کرده و ساخته است- «لویاتان» نام می‌دهد، که از آن موجود افسانه‌ای و رمزی کتاب مقدس و به ویژه کتاب ایوب گرفته شده است. هابز این لویاتان را در تصویر معروف چاپ اول اثر نشان داده است: ‌غولی تاج‌دار که شمشیری در یک دست و عصای پاپی در دست دیگر دارد. به عبارت دیگر، لویاتان نیروی نظامی و روحانی را در اختیار دارد که سلطه بر اجسام و وجدانها را به او اعطا می‌کند. روح مصنوعی لویاتان از حاکمیت؛ مفاصل او از صاحبان مناصب؛ اعضای او قوای قضاییه و مجریه؛ اعصاب او پاداش و مجازات؛ نیروی او رفاه و ثروت همه اعضا به طور خاص؛ فعالیت او از رستگاری مردم؛ حافظه او از رایزنان؛ عقل و اراده او قوانین و مصوبه‌ها، سلامت او از اجماع، بیماری او از شورش، مرگ او از جنگ داخلی تشکیل شده است؛ و کلمه «کُنْ» الاهی و آفرینش انسان در سفر پیدایش، از میثاقها و قراردادهایی فراهم آمده است که نخستین‌بار اجزای مختلف جسم سیاسی را جمع و وحدت بخشید. نظریه سیاسی دو بخش دیگر اثر به طور کلی اندیشه‌های بیان شده در خصوص شهروند را از سر می‌گیرد، مگر در مواردی که هابز به نظر می‌آید که از زندگی سیاسی پرآشوب زمان خود درسی آموخته باشد. کسی که در لحظه آزادی گردن به اطاعت فاتحی می‌گذارد با بیان صریح یا علامات کافی دیگر رضایت می‌دهد که رعیت او باشد. این وضعیت در مورد کسی که در برابر حاکم خود تعهد دیگری جز تعهد رعیت معمولی ندارد تکرار می‌شود. قانون مدنی تعهدات پیوسته با قوانین طبیعی و اصل عدالت در تضاد است. احترام به دیگران و فضیلتهای دیگری که از قانون مدنی ناشی می‌شود و صلح و اطاعت را به دنبال می‌آورد، به محض تشکیل دولت، به قوانین طبیعی تبدیل می‌شود و بنابراین از این حیث که قدرت حاکم احترام به آنها را الزا‌م‌آور می‌داند، قوانین مدنی نیز هستند. بخش نانوشته قانون طبیعی خوانده می‌شود و بخش نوشته آن مدنی، قانون مدنی آزادی طبیعی افراد را محدود می‌کند تا آنان نتوانند به یکدیگر ضرر برسانند، بلکه به یکدیگر یاری برسانند و در برابر دشمن مشترک متحد شوند. قانون مدنی تحت نظارت پادشاه و پارلمان – در صورتی که سلطنت پارلمانی باشد- قرار دارد. سلطنت به هیچ‌وجه با قدرت مذهبی محدود نمی‌شود، زیرا که قلمرو امور دنیوی و مذهبی یگانه‌اند؛ حاکم را نمی‌توان با قدرت مذهبی طرد و تکفیر کرد، زیرا که شهریار نمی‌تواند خود را تکفیر کند. تکفیر رعیتی که به پادشاه وفادار باشد فاقد هرگونه اثر است. کشیشان وظیفه خود را به نام و تحت اقتدار حاکم مدنی یا «قانون عرفی» انجام می‌دهند. اما پادشاه، یا هرحاکم دیگری، وظیفه عالیه دینی خود را با تکیه بر اقتدار بلافصل ناشی از خدا یا «قانون شرعی» انجام می‌دهد. بنابراین، هرکس که به اطاعت از پادشاه گردن نهد و به خدا بودن مسیح اعتراف کند، مسیحی خوبی است.(!!) بدین‌سان، قدرت مطلقه دولت که بر شالوده دریافتی کاملاً مادی و سودجویانه از دولت استوار است، عالی‌ترین بیان خود را در لویاتان پیدا کرده است و این بیان تا جایی پیش می‌رود که آنگاه که پادشاه یا دولت نتوانند از شهروندان دفاع کنند، وفاداری مردم نسبت به آنان نفی می‌شود، زیرا که تنها دلیل اطاعت از آنان تأمین امنیت شهروند است,290 reviews,Rating 4 out of 5,None,fa,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,neutral

Peter Crouse,"The mid-17th century tumultuous time Europe. England Germany recovering violent civil wars; France barely withstood rebellion disgruntled nobility; mighty Spanish Empire sinking decay; Turks would soon pounding gates Vienna. Out murky depths emerged Hobbes’s Leviathan, political treatise advocates absolute authority sovereignty effective means withstand all-too-familiar evils civil strife. Man, according Hobbes, fundamentally motivated selfish material desires continually place state discord fellow human beings; state which, infamous phrase, renders life “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish short”. To lift us condition perpetual fear, constructed natural laws constrain us, mutual agreement, live peace one another give rise all-powerful sovereign alone possesses authority legislate, arbitrate indoctrinate good society. Hobbes recognizes power vested either individual assembly; but, like Plato, prefers absolute monarchy democracy, believes nothing nest divided opinion deceiving oratory. Whatever case, Hobbes’s society subject one predominant virtue: obedience. I can’t deny one main benefits state provide peace security citizens. Hobbes horrified blood-letting England’s recent Puritan Revolution constructed system hopes avoiding return savage condition man-against-man. But say primary function state serve bulwark chaos proceed thoroughly negative, manichean interpretation creates far evils seeks avoid. What happens sovereign unjust? While Hobbes admits possibility, believes better obey silence rather permit dissent risk dissolution commonwealth. This repugnant Hobbesianism: elevates sovereign law; provides man freedom thought without giving freedom action; declares better man kneel beneath rod submit lash, rather realize dictates conscience. Where spirit Humanism? Where Aristotle’s conception man naturally political animal? Strangely, Hobbes denies ruler authority based newly emerging doctrine divine right. While God’s representative earth, ultimately derive authority based agreement amongst people. But people give, lawfully take away? The theological core Hobbes’s argument, agreement subject sovereign cannot undone represents agreement God, contradiction brings theory ground. As aside, Leviathan’s combination theology together novelty would become social contract theory reveals root latter lie emphasis covenants within Calvinist tradition. I find Leviathan vile tractate, serve warning would deny idealism place human affairs. In addition, fact it’s written Ye Olde Aenglish, certainly fault Hobbes, made tedious difficult read. The latter half’s focus ecclesiology, inserted deny church authority independent sovereign, completes Hobbes's world view, full-to-the-brim references Mosaic law adds work’s anachronistic feel. Far better spend time liberalism John Stuart Mill. The last section, sub-titled On Kingdom Darkness, explanation (largely papist) factors lead ignorance disillusion mankind. My advice Hobbes consign Leviathan abyss.","41 reviews

Jacob Aitken,"In beginning treatise Hobbes stays close “Received Tradition.” He make troubling moves, though, quite subtlely. He rejects idea “Summum Bonum.” His definition natural law leaves reference eternal law mind God. He views liberty zero-sum game anticipates (with approval) predatory capitalism. Key themes: Anthropology: Hobbes begins anthropology, politics logical inferences it. Hobbes defines “Body” occupies space. Substance matter, synonymous body. The soul simply body living. He specifically rejects idea soul distinct body (639). Hobbes defined man purely material terms. Not surprisingly, Hobbes rejects free agency. Liberty necessity thing: man freely does. Yet every act man desire, cause. And another cause, way back First Cause. This appears Jonathan Edwards’ view well. Social Contract: institution commonwealth, every man right everything means preserve (354). This means State never make unjust law. P1: Justice two agree exchange (if agree, exchange). P2: You agreed invest state authority (social contract). ________________ Therefore, law state makes automatically agreement. Zero-Sum ethics: Hobbes holds mine cannot yours; state liberty, subject degree cannot. Since summum bonum, sharing ultimate good. This, plain simple, economics Hell. Hobbes pure capitalist, though. He argues elsewhere private charity state welfare (387). Religious Persecution Hobbes argues religious persecution impossible, since 1) state can't wrong, 2) martyrs persecuted. Further (2a) person martyr seen risen Jesus, rules everyone Apostle John. Therefore, one today martyr. Keep mind thousands Scottish Covenanters butchered basis Hobbes’ argument. This reminds time RTS local Reformed pastor came book store told held Hobbes’s view state. I kept mouth shut I didn’t want end FEMA camp. Critique My critique follow Dabney’s (The Sensualistic Philosophy, pp. 15-20). Hobbes pay high price materialism. If everything reduces sensation, whence come numbers, mind, correspondence mind external world, priori judgments, logic, abstract entities? If everything sensation, unites sensations? (Hume’s famous line “a bundle sensations”) Hobbes would answer yet another sensation. But unites sensation previous sensations? Ad infinitum. If Hobbes bites bullet rejects need unity, needs give concepts like identity (and probably concept ""concept"" itself). This fatal consequence rejecting philosophical realism. Hobbes split One Many. His power-state collapses everything One, yet nominalism reduces everything aggregate unconnected Many. Conclusion I give book 1 star demonic content 5 stars influence. Indeed, rebutting Hobbes like casting demonic strongholds (2 Corinthians 10). It’s fairly easy read mistaking influence (the “Father Political Science”).","1,551 reviews

Garrett Cash,"I pleased report Thomas Hobbes's landmark work political philosophy ""poor, nasty, brutish, short."" It exceedingly well-written, systematic, lucid, quite compelling. Despite fact I certainly would call monarchist, I frankly quite surprised much I tended agree Hobbes's arguments. His conclusions quite logical grounded view human nature I would tend agree with. His view we're absence authoritarian government away killing other. He makes several great points makes sense choose monarchy democracy aristocracy (which concluded really three forms commonwealth). I'm convinced veracity arguments I've actually scared myself. What I'm monarchist deep down? Time read Paine's see head straightened. P.S. This would easily five star book long-winded section Christian commonwealth second half book. actually four books put one, I rate separately I would give five stars , four stars . P.P.S. I've wanting read book long time, I finally read class I'm currently taking church that's sort ""books screwed world"" course. I found interesting started sort pair Machiavelli's . I read I loved it, I interested find I liked professor thought bad enough put list. Now, I respect professor degrees politics extremely knowledgeable Scripture (he excellent introductory book Bibliology find ) I disagreed Hobbes's character. He painted Hobbes ""Biblical skeptic"" ""functional Christian nominal atheist."" I'm sure Hobbes went apostate since I know much life story, possible way man wrote ""functional atheist"" time. Hobbes shows deep understanding Scripture theology, I agreed theological assessments major issues. He clearly understands Gospel salvation obtained. As supposed Biblical skepticism, says: ""I persuaded [church scribes] therefore falsify Scriptures, though copies books New Testament hands ecclesiastics; intention so, would surely made favourable power Christian princes, civil sovereignty, are. I see therefore reason doubt, Old, New Testament, now, true registers things, done said prophets, apostles."" Clearly, unambiguous statement -Biblical skepticism. I think might long time since professor read perhaps Hobbes makes contradictory statements others works I'm aware of.","649 reviews

Luke,"Let begin saying I agree Hobbes philosophy, certainly it. Perhaps this'll change time, perhaps won't. But practical terms, work. I even believe would've worked Hobbes time, modern World, certainly not. On laws nature, I agree. Indeed, entrenched society today - whether right judge allowing man judge. Of laws complaisance, arrogance, pride, self-preservation, seek peace - indeed, measure law on, sentence Hobbes uses 'Do another, thou wouldest done thy sefle' - I cannot disagree it. I find fault there. But laws equity, holding things common proportionately, deciding lot gets - really aren't, me, laws nature, objectively right. But speaks Papacy wrongful interpretation gain (although advocating sovereign deciding right prevent discord distasteful, supports Tuck's view Christian Atheism) - I can't disagree either. His analysis humanity especially true. But I said, views Christianity times differing mine, views sometimes distasteful. But Hobbes speaks need absolute sovereign, I entirely convinced. I believe requirement elite. In aristocrats, were. I believe sovereign, sovereign holds unquestionable authority worth Her Majesty. But theory, whilst Hobbes dress up, practice would occur. Hobbes seems idea Plato king, sovereign, would entirely wholesomely perfect. This so. This never so. Hobbes dress would bound Covenant principle rights, biblical Word God Christ, Natural Laws govern man - happen - indeed, laws, implicit already realises this. Yes, there'll great Monarchs time - Queen Elizabeth II absolute sovereign would fine pick, Henry Eighth would've fine went mad, far between. And power counteracted could moral political retardation occurs - moment course, retardation occurred, need Parliament, need sovereign - paramount. We cannot absolute sovereign, Hobbes' explicitly disallows power divided rightly points make fall, simply cannot work. So indeed, I believe wholly Laws Nature. I believe things Hobbes written on. But core principle? I'm struggling. And thoughts Hell? I, too, different view. And I think I'll keep struggling on. He's undoubtedly great writer deserves place. And edition I read, Cambridge edition, great one fantastic introduction great accompaniments, plainly set out. But course, this'll one re-read again... maybe, time evolves, I'll change mind.

It especially interesting see contract based theory looks like century Adam Smith published Wealth Nations. There relatively little discussion contracts promoting efficient outcomes quite lot discussion fairness, enforcement, clarity, fair dealing -- would talked today terms agency issues. What Hobbes talking earthly commonwealth, basis, operations, sparkling.

Cemre,"Leviathan, benim çok önem verdiğim yapıtlardan biri; çünkü akademik açıdan bana yön veren kitapların başında geliyor. Üniversite ikinci sınıftayken sadece ""hukuk felesefesi""ni ilgilendiren kısımlarını okumuştuk, -orijinal dilinin de ağır olması nedeniyle- zamandan bu yana Türkçesinden okumak istiyordum Leviathan'ı. Özellikle hukukla, siyasetle ilgilenen kimselerin mutlaka okuması gereken bir kitap olduğunu düşünüyorum, hakikaten birçok konuyu kapsaması bakımından büyük bir önem teşkil ediyor. Kitap, dört bölümden oluşmakta: İnsan Üzerine, Devlet Üzerine, Hristiyan Bir Devlet Üzerine, Karanlığın Krallığı Üzerine. İlk iki bölümü zevkle okudum; ancak son iki bölümdeki Hristiyan dini ilgili konuların bolluğu bu konularla çok haşır neşir olmadığımdan beni biraz bunalttı. Hobbes'un temel felsefesi, insanların eşit olduğu üzerine kurulu. İnsanlar eşit şey üzerinde eşit haklara sahipler. İşte bu nedenle de A'nın istediğini B de isteyebilir ikisinin de şey üzerinde aynı hakkı vardır. A, şeyi elde etmek için B'yi yok edebilir, bir bakıma bunu yapmak durumundadır da bu da adaletsiz ya da yanlış olmaz. Diğer bir ifadeyle insanın eşit oluşu, kişiyi bir diğerini yok etmeye ya da egemenliği altına almaya çalışmasına yöneltmektedir. Hal böyle olunca da doğa durumundaki insan daimi bir savaş içindedir. İşte Hobbes'a göre insanlar, savaş durumundan barış durumuna geçebilmek adına, güvenliklerinin sağlanabilmesi amacıyla birtakım haklarından feragat ederler bu haklarını bir ""egemen""e devrederler. Bu doğa yasalarının bir sonucudur. Yani insanın aklıyla keşfettiği kendisine zarar verecek şeyleri yapmamasını emreden yasaların sonucudur. Birinci doğa yasası barışı aramak izlemektir, ikincisi ise barışı sürdürmek. İkinci yasaya uymak adına haklarını egemene, üstün güce, devreden insanlar daha sonra bundan dönemezler. Aksi bir durum adil değildir. Bu noktadan sonra da insanlar egemenlerine koşulsuz şartsız uymakla yükümlüdürler. Hobbes'un devletin ortaya çıkış nedeni olarak sunduğu görüşlere yakın hissediyorum kendi görüşlerimi; ancak Hobbes'un egemene gereğinden fazla yetkiler yüklediğini düşünüyorum. Örneğin Hobbes, egemenin en sonunda bir tirana dönüşmesinin bile savaş durumundan daha iyi olacağını savunuyor. Hobbes'a göre haklarını devredenlerin daha sonradan devrettikleri kişiye karşı ayaklanmaları mümkün değil, ayaklansalar da bu doğru değildir. Ayrıca Hobbes egemeni bir nevi ""yanılmaz güç"" olarak ilân ediyor; çünkü egemenin diğer insanlardan yetki aldığını, yetkilerini aldığı kişilere karşı da onların yetkileriyle haksızlık edemeyeceğini savunuyor. Egemen insafsızlık edebilir; ancak bu tam bir adaletsizlik ya da haksızlık değildir diyor; ama beni kesinlikle ikna edemediğini belirtmem lazım. Bence insanı birbiriyle savaş durumundan çıkarıp bambaşka bir savaş ortamına sürüklüyor. Benim için başlangıcı mantıklı olan teorisi sonrasında çöküyor diyebilirim. Leviathan, ilk iki bölüm itibariyle hem bir hukuk kitabı, hem bir siyaset bilimi kitabı. Hukuk derslerinin bir kısmında işlenen ilkelerin pek çoğunu görmek mümkün. Bunun yanı sıra son iki bölüm itibariyle de Hristiyanlık üzerine ciddi söylemleri olan bir kitap. Özellikle ilk iki bölümün mutlaka dikkatle okunması gerektiğini düşünüyorum.","679 reviews

Brett,"Leviathan historically important document cornerstone early political philosophy, boy feel distant concerns modern world. The argument Hobbes makes boils version this: absolute ruling authority polis, factions bound engage struggle eventually combat political power. In Hobbes' estimation, civil wars evil avoided costs, hence need strong ruler prevent taking place. Without rule, man exist Hobbes refers ""state nature."" This state dog eat dog, everyone themselves, dystopia. It's view human nature plausibility--we've seen people behave self-interested self-centered ways. The famous quote familiar Leviathan follows: ""the life man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish short."" It perhaps understandable position given reality English civil war Hobbes lived through. But us come around rounded view human race. We times selfish, course. But totality human experience. And hundreds years since Leviathan, nations good deal success various experiments democracy. In present day, even revanchist writer least must nod direction democracy obtain credibility, hard come terms Hobbes' critique. Over time, drifted Hobbes' point view, us thankful done so. Sure, plenty disputes much democracy optimal amount, whether may better experts making decisions (a la Fed) would openly argue prudent entirely remove public decision making process. When Hobbes done denigrating Greek Roman systems democracy, anxious explain thinks Christianity supports view politics. Then, really entire back half book dedicated long-winded arguments finer points Christian belief. I charitably call section ""not engaging"" note I often found I read several pages memory ostensibly passed mind. I also lodge minor complaint language book way updated Hobbes' original, meaning modern reader fair amount parsing language come understanding passage means. Maybe I lazy, I would appreciated editor could clarified writing make easier me. So falls category book I read misplaced sense obligation.

It's entirely possible you, theoretical future reader book, better student me, find sublime core insight I missed. But you, I doubts.","590 reviews

James Hatton,"Gadzooks! This hard book read! “Leviathan” published 1651, smack dab middle Early Modern English period (1500-1800). Hobbes born 1588, twenty-four years Shakespeare, word choices sentence structures similar. On top that, seems lot say, dreadful detail. At end second part book declares, “… short, I think clear…” Well, no, Thomas, you’ve neither short clear. And top that, brother, next two parts (III IV) go downhill here. I read last two parts (III IV); they’re hard read—more below. I read A Review Conclusion, end. Overall, tough me. It worth reading, fun—two stars. Still, interest topics book per se (i.e. political science, social contract, state nature—solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, short, etc.), interest veiled condemnation Cromwell Parliamentarians ax beheaded Charles I, you’d like read carefully subtle condemnation English Civil War (1642-1651), you’d like experience Early Modern English baffling glory, there’s lot book you.

I couldn’t remember I stopped Part III ten years ago, I remember. Part III begins two parts Hobbes tries prove, disprove sorts things Bible, things comprised contemporaneous theology countrymen. I believe SUCH EFFORT IS TOTALLY MISSING THE POINT OF THE BIBLE! The Bible need proved, disproved. I recommend reading Bible. I’ve read several times. But important message therein paramount: love God love one another (Leviticus 19:18, Matthew 32:37-40, John 13:34-35). And way, command, message. Peace.","293 reviews

Alex,"I suppose read part course, may, extent tarnish ones appreciation book. Perhaps one first reasons I choose give Leviathan 2 stars. Let start saying student politics would find Hobbes truly invaluable especially wish philosophically critique majority things political. Of course, must also realise Hobbes, writing did, almost impenetrable arduous read, expressly convoluted, headache inducing stuff, actually understand means, require reading once. Here comes next issue book. Hobbes, understanding 'state nature' 'social contract', logical discrepancies statements, deems, escape environment constant turmoil, death destruction, man must enter social contract, and, far concerned suspend almost every single one natural rights. Hobbes allow some, example, leviathan rules man may force man harm himself, go war him, man may refuse much. Oh Hobbes says ok Man executed refuse leviathans request go war, I guess freedom man may maintain really much freedom all. Additionally, I would argue Hobbes becomes increasingly irrelevant considering modern political society, type dictatorial notions Hobbes advocates longer place modern democracy, though, adaption, may place providing argument greater authoritarianism. In all, I would exactly recommend book anybody subscribes modern school political thought, likely sharpen arsenal, course, student politics, definitely worth while.","34 reviews

Teresa R.,"El Leviatán es un libro muy moderno para su época en el sentido en que, pesar de defender el absolutismo, proclama que la soberanía del gobernante procede únicamente de Dios -como se venía defendiendo hasta la época- sino también de un pacto entre el soberano los súbditos, por el cuál estos se comprometen renunciar su libertad obedecer al rey, cambio de que éste asegure la paz seguridad de sus súbditos. El Leviatán -es decir, el Estado- es, pues, un cuerpo artificial, un sumatorio de todos los súbditos de un territorio concreto. El libro estaba resultando muy interesante hasta que llegué la tercera parte, ""De un Estado cristiano"". A partir de ahí Hobbes se centra demasiado en hablar de pasajes de las Sagradas Escrituras y...

Kolmannessa osassa kristityn teologian, erityisesti raamatun, sisältöä rinnastetaan maallisen valtion johtamiseen ja vallanjakoon Teoksessa keskustellaan vallan etiikasta, oikeudenmukaisuudesta sekä luonnonoikeuden ja lainsäädännön suhteesta ihmisiä ohjaavina voimina.","143 reviews

Pradžioje skaitėsi įdomiai ir lengvai - parašyta labai geru stiliumi, bet ilgainiui pradėjau nesutikti su Hobbes'o idėjomis apie suvereno sudievinimą, jo absoliutų teisingumą ir apie draudimą protestuoti prieš aukščiausią valdžią, juo labiau ją nuversti ar bent jau pakeisti valdymo formą. Dar vienas trūkumas - tas Leviatano statymas, valstybės ypatumus paverčiant metaforomis apie žmogaus kūną - atrodė vaikiškai ir nerimtai. Visumoje visai nieko skaitalas, bet Hobbes'as tikrai toli gražu nėra tas autoritetas, kuriuo remčiausi.",85 reviews,Rating 3 out of 5,None,lt,0.0,0.699,0.301,0.9367,positive

Matt Person,"Wow. Most wishes I would've read foreward maybe Part I. Then given up. Hobbes's philosophical treatise explanation nature man (human) regarding innate passions motions part I actually really interesting/insightful (reminded lot Kant's aesthetic explanations), WOW I lose interest Part II never really returned. Part II exercise pedanticism far I'm concerned. I even know Part III IV I limited familiarity old new testaments. And honestly reading felt like rehashing scripture testaments comparison commonwealth ideas introduced Bible; though I least see motivation. Anyway, yeah. Um, I one rate book. I appreciate impact, revolutionary controversial, society civil war England, certainly appreciate sort corner Hobbes placed (similar Machiavelli's exile motivation Prince), I FEEL rest ;) That said, I certainly least approach appreciation stirring pot masterpiece caused.","78 reviews
