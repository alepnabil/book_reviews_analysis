0,Ahmad Sharabiani,"Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil, Thomas Hobbes

Leviathan, is a book written by Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) and published in 1651 (revised Latin edition 1668).

Its name derives from the biblical Leviathan. The work concerns the structure of society and legitimate government, and is regarded as one of the earliest and most influential examples of social contract theory. Leviathan ranks as a classic Western work on statecraft comparable to Machiavelli's The Prince.

Written during the English Civil War (1642–1651), Leviathan argues for a social contract and rule by an absolute sovereign.

1,Yasiru,"Since some reviewers here seem to rate this work unfairly low because of their disagreements, ignoring both the importance of Leviathan and the basic power of the argument Hobbes forwards in it, I'll refer a couple of good, measured reviews with history and backdrop also found here-






Originally I planned to adapt an essay I wrote at university on Hobbes and Leviathan (with comparisons against Locke, Rousseau and others) to serve as a review, but it's rather unwieldy and a few of its less esoteric and elaborate points have been made very well and succinctly in some of the accounts above.

Hobbes is the most influential figure in political thinking when it comes to what might broadly be called 'pessimistic philosophy' (contra Leibniz), and in this sense he makes an excellent, more formal and treatise-like accompaniment to the works of Voltaire (whose '' especially are, beyond the characteristic wit on display, also immensely enjoyable; Kafka, and to certain more personal extent Beckett, are also commendable reads). He doesn't so much set out a modus operandi for a ruler as the Arthshastra or The Prince attempt to do, but tries to justify the power to be accorded a ruler, basically obliterating some of the more open concerns a statesman might have to tactically contend with in Machiavelli. But it may be that of all of Leviathan's contributions, the eponymous Leviathan in the sense of an absolute monarch is the superfluous part.
Given its age, the language of Leviathan is remarkably clear and precise, emphatic as necessary and quite accessible. Hobbes sets out his arguments with almost mathematical proof-like care however, and the book may require patience. I had lecture notes to guide me through when I first read important selections, and perhaps something of that nature will be helpful.

I more recently found it a fascinating exercise to study the thought of this 'school' (roughly speaking) in the context of modern evolutionary thinking as found in very accessible but also rigorous accounts like by Richard Dawkins.
Of course, just as science with its empirical concerns does not prescribe but might inform efficient and effective methods for achieving an aim, the pessimists are not prescriptive- they simply caution in the way dystopia in fiction doesn't provide constructive commentary as utopia does, but serve (when done right, in the manner of Orwell for instance) as elaborate warning tales. It is wrong to think of them, especially Hobbes, as social Darwinists. There is willful misinterpretation on nearly every side of modern politics when it comes to philosophers like Hobbes so that arguments which come from the pedestrian self-help-esque philosophy of the likes of Ayn Rand or readings that miss the outré humour of de Sade can be cloaked in the appearance of erudition and thus made less incendiary when shamelessly carted out. This propensity is far from lessened by the argument in Leviathan for monarchy and the easy clamour citing this gains from those blinded and made to follow complacently by the very term 'democracy', whether true in fact or not.

It is perfectly fair to say that Hobbes, with interests very relevant to him personally in his day, fails to give due consideration to other forms of governance than the one he advocates, but this shortcoming does not invalidate or at all detract from the conundrum he poses about trust within his 'state of nature', or the dangers of it. The situation is akin to the from game theory and there is the question of what's rational for the society on the whole against what is rational for the individual at each decision. The implications from biology of trust-favouring behaviours and the evolutionarily stable equilibria which may come about through such strategies further elucidate our notions on the human condition when considered alongside the basic problem.",False,,,197,115,5.0,138.0,4.0,en,"Since reviewers seem rate work unfairly low disagreements, ignoring importance Leviathan basic power argument Hobbes forwards it, I'll refer couple good, measured reviews history backdrop also found here- Originally I planned adapt essay I wrote university Hobbes Leviathan (with comparisons Locke, Rousseau others) serve review, rather unwieldy less esoteric elaborate points made well succinctly accounts above.

2,Czarny Pies,"Both the conclusions and methodology of ""Leviathan"" are shocking to the modern reader.
Writing in the seventeenth century, Hobbes attacked medieval political philosophy and religion. However, unlike the enlightenment philosophers he did not base his arguments on the classical authors of Greece and Rome. Instead he made it clear that he considered them to be as much in the wrong as the medieval scholastics. Thus starting from zero, Hobbes then developed the doctrine that every nation or commonwealth requires a undivided sovereign. To the contemporary reader, Hobbes seems to be arguing that we would all be best living in a totalitarian regime.

In Hobbes view men are evil wishing by instinct to dominate and exploit their fellow men. Hence every commonwealth needs to be ruled by a strong sovereign to protect the members of the commonwealth from each other. The sovereign can be a single person, an aristocracy or a democracy. The single person system is best as it allows the most complete concentration of power.

For Hobbes a king and a tyrant are the same thing. Thus the Greeks and Romans of the classical era were wrong to praise tyrannicide and condemn regicide. Both were equally wrong. The crime of the long parliament was not that it executed Charles I, the divinely chosen King of England, but that it killed the sovereign and ensured that civil war would resume in England. Cromwell's great virtue was that he ended the war and protected the English population. The supremet good for the commonwealth member is to support the sovereign.

With the goal of demonstrating that the doctrine of the divine right of kings is nonsense, Hobbes devotes two of the four books of Leviathan to proving that religion is absurd. He fills pages referring to all the contradictions and absurdities in the Christian bible. He points out that there is no way to properly determine which texts belong in the bible and which do not. Even if one believes in God, one has to deal with the second problem which is that there is no way to prove the claims of any of those who claim to speak for God that they are indeed his representatives. Finally, Hobbes points out that the doctrine of the divine right of kings as defended by the Roman Catholic Church has no basis in scripture. Protestants, however, have little reason to be happy with Hobbes as he also demonstrates that many of their doctrines also lack basis in scripture.

Despite his audacity and vigour, posterity has not been kind to Hobbes. Absolutism and totalitarianism are dirty words in today's society. The political thinkers of the eighteenth century returned to the classical theory proposed by many authors but most eloquently by Polybius that the ideal situation is for power in a state to be divided between a king, an aristocracy and a democratically elected assembly. The problem is of course that it is easier to argue against Hobbes than it is to fight totalitarianism's instinctive appeal. In times of crisis, people tend to support strong dictators like Franco, protectors like Cromwell or strong men like Putin.",False,,,2412,1,5.0,50.0,4.0,en,"Both conclusions methodology ""Leviathan"" shocking modern reader.

12 Oct 2017

Woah, after three weeks I have finally managed to finish the behemoth of a book (which, ironically, Hobbes also wrote a book with that name) and I can now move onto something much lighter. Anyway, there was a time, when I was younger, when I was dreaming of one day getting married, having children, while becoming a hot shot lawyer (is it possible to actually do those two things) that I wanted to read this to my proposed child while he (or she) was still a baby. Mind you, I suggested this to one of my Christian friends, who proceeded to have a heart attack claiming that it was a humanist text similar to the writings of . Mind you, this particular person is now a lecturer in English Literature at Harvard University so I am still wondering why she was hugely shocked at this idea. Maybe it had something to do with wanting to read it to a baby.

Anyway, this is apparently the book that laid the foundation for political science as we know it today, though I am sort of scratching my head at this suggestion. First of all people have been writing about politics since people first tossed out their unelected kings and began to argue as to the best way to run a country, Mind you, those particular people, such as , pretty quickly came to the conclusion that letting the mob make the rules on a principle of popularity was a pretty bad idea so decided to go back to the drawing board to work out how they can have a system where smart people actually run the country. Mind you, as my Classics history lecturer once told us, the problem with that idea was that all of the smart people actually had much better things to do than running a country. Okay, maybe Plato, being a smart person, would have been perfect for that position, but he seemed to end up spending more time trying to teach rulers how to be a smart ruler, and failing abysmally. As it turned out, being a smart ruler isn't a particularly easy thing to do, and in the end it is much easier to collect taxes and then use the said taxes to build palaces and to go around beating up all the people you don't like. At least had the right idea.

Hobbs seems to follow Plato's opinion, though he doesn't go as far as Machiavelli in actually telling rulers how to be successful rulers. Rather he spends the time exploring the nature of government, and instead of coming up with unworkable ideas, he basically looks at what is around him, and the traditions of the past, to come to the conclusion that the best form of government is a monarchical government based upon the principles of scripture. His theory is basically that because God is sovereign, and because God is the perfect ruler, then ergo the best form of government is that of a Christian king. However, as I have mentioned, the book is pretty chunky, and half of it deals with a theological exposition as to why the Bible supports monarchy. Well, not quite because he does come back to the point in the book of Samuel where the Israelites demand a king, and the main reason that happens is because the Israelites had decided that living under the constitution that God laid out was just that little too hard, and it seems that all of the nations around them were having a awful lot of fun, so why not just live like them. Well, for those of us who know their Bible know how that turned out.

A little context is probably in order though. Hobbes wrote this book during the English Civil war, which was an incredibly messy affair. Basically you had the Catholic monarch on one side wanting to do things his way, and the protestant parliament on the other side basically telling him to bugger off and mind his own business. Things got messier, and messier, and it resulted in Charles basically having his head lopped off. Well, that didn't particularly solve anything because, much like the French revolution, it left a power vacuum. Well, not quite, because they did have Oliver Cormwell, but it turned out that they didn't have an effective succession plan in place, and in the end, when Cormwell died, his son took over, with the resultant mess that ended up with them asking the king to come back and take over.

Hobbes' ideas probably won't sit well in our so called advanced Democracies these days, but then again look at who landed up as President of the United States – a Reality TV star. Okay, he wasn't the only actor to have been elected President, but at least Reagan was a tried and true union man (if you consider the Screen Actors Guild a union, but serious – it is). Mind you, we in Australia can't comment because we elected Tony Abbott – a misogynist that when asked what he felt about the LGBT community, the reply was 'they make me feel uncomfortable'. Actually, when asked to comment on an Australian soldier that was killed in Afghanistan, he reply was 'shit happens' (I kid you not). Well, at least you can say that that is the typical Australian response.

Mind you, while I'm no big fan of totalitarianism, you have to admit that this whole democratic experiment, at least in the west, is pretty messed up. Well, not quite, because the Germans have seemed to have worked it out quite well, and seem to be chugging along quite happily. Even the British seem to have some reasonably level headed people in power (and whatever you think of Teresa May, at least she is nowhere near as bad as Tony Abbot, or the Trumpet for that matter).

Yet, despite Hobbes not really being as applicable to our times, in a way he is. He was looking at a country that was in a complete mess and his solution was to go back to the tried and true method – a king – it certainly had to be better that people running around shooting each other. Maybe we could solve our problems by asking Angela Merkel to come over here and sort us out. Hey, at least the Norwegians made sure that the mining companies actually paid for all of the minerals they took out of their lands – over here we simply let them take them. If I were to walk into a shop and start helping myself to all of their goodies I'd be arrested.

This naïveté in political legitimacy is analogous to the popularity of the New Testament compared to the Old because, while both texts share equal moral instruction, we fervently prefer a loving and forgiving God to a brutal taskmaster. Hobbesian pessimism in human nature is a cold bucket of water tempering our enthusiastic assumption of a free polis because it demonstrates how democratic freedom is contingent upon the behavior everyone demonstrates.

My political science professor’s ad hominem disparagement of Hobbes as paranoid and neurotic was troubling, given that Hobbes’s support for a Leviathan with absolute sovereignty remains a soberly empirical definition of power and fundamental governmental purpose. Fear of death is the primary motivation for our surrender to political authority. A government's legitimacy therefore necessitates the capacity for retributive action against internal and external threats. The power of the individual and group is relational to the behavioral impact they exact on others. Individual rights and liberties independent of government remain the exception, not the rule, of most persons throughout recorded history, past and present.

How and why do the rights outlined by John Locke, that we often take for granted, exist at all? They depend on the internal morality of the individual who receives them, which themselves depend on Enlightenment values held dear by everyone around that person. I do not think that we are born blank slates in the state of nature, or cynically view moral sentiments as a vacuous social construct. Reading Hobbes’s brutal state and laws of nature, however, brought to mind the inculcations of parents, Sunday School instructors and Sesame Street screenwriters. Socrates’s description of a rational portion of our brain that holds back the appetitive beast within us, for example, is emblematic of an internal Leviathan each individual conscience tacitly consents to for a free society to be possible.

The gradual shift in favorability towards democracy, from Socratic aversion to Jeffersonian approval based upon Locke, reflected the piecemeal formation of internal Leviathans that made democracy possible. Plato’s polemical attack in the Republic against democracy as an ideology suited for morally relativistic pigs made sense, given the amorality of those around him who ignored philosophic truth and diffidently sentenced Socrates to death. His opposition to democracy reflected the observable reality of Hobbes’s first law of nature, namely an avaricious Tony Montana attitude commonly held towards other individuals and groups at that time. Democracy only became a viable alternative to absolute sovereignty after the humble and prudential values diffused by the burgeoning bourgeoisie of Locke’s time attained widespread acceptance. If the hypothetical man of the state of nature is self-reliantly rational and reasonable rather than nasty and brutish, we can entrust him with freedom without risking our security from death.

The American middle class is often derisively mocked at my University for the values its members hold dear. Their sexual abstention, proudly traditional religiosity, and lowly aspirations for a quiet life of monetary gain with a nuclear family strike many supposed “free spirits” as an archaic edifice to topple.

گاه به‌گاه هابز نتیجه‌گیری‌هایی می‌کند که در واقع هیچ ارتباطی به برهان‌هایش ندارد. مثلا هرچیز موجود در طبیعت را به دولت تعمیم می‌دهد در صورتی که دولت و پیدایش آن ربطی به طبیعت ندارد حتی چنانچه پاسخ منطقی انسان به محیط پیرامونش دانسته شود.

It's interesting to think that this book is the fundamental root of a lot of ultra-conservative brains. On some level, I can understand this. Hobbes defends the divine right of royal power (to a certain extent) and proceeds to define this power as absolute. Without question, subjects must bow to their masters, under any circumstances. In all this, however, he ultimately says that a monarch's power is granted him by his subjects, for without subjects a monarch is king of nothing, decrees cannot be carried out, etc.

I don't remember the text of the book all that much. I read it mostly while on the bus to my job at Domino's Pizza a couple years ago. I suppose it comforted me to think that having to deal with my egomaniacal boss was a work of divine devotion, as opposed to an oppressive hell. The book did convince me of some truths that needed accepting at the time, that for all the brutality of my boss at work, he would ultimately fall, when his actions became tyrannical enough to convince his employees that he was not fit to rule. Which they did forthwith, and he was subsequently fired. So they told me.

""The sovereign has twelve principal rights:

1. because a successive covenant cannot override a prior one, the subjects cannot (lawfully) change the form of government.

2. because the covenant forming the commonwealth results from subjects giving to the sovereign the right to act for them, the sovereign cannot possibly breach the covenant; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign.

3. the sovereign exists because the majority has consented to his rule; the minority have agreed to abide by this arrangement and must then assent to the sovereign's actions.

4. every subject is author of the acts of the sovereign: hence the sovereign cannot injure any of his subjects and cannot be accused of injustice.

5. the sovereign cannot justly be put to death by the subjects.

6. because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace, and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord. Therefore, the sovereign may judge what opinions and doctrines are averse, who shall be allowed to speak to multitudes, and who shall examine the doctrines of all books before they are published.

7. to prescribe the rules of civil law and property.

8. to be judge in all cases.

9. to make war and peace as he sees fit and to command the army.

10. to choose counsellors, ministers, magistrates and officers.

11. to reward with riches and honour or to punish with corporal or pecuniary punishment or ignominy.

12. to establish laws about honour and a scale of worth. "" (got this list from wikipedia but this is in chapter 18 of part one)

15,Tristram Shandy,"Scared Shitless but Not Witless

In his autobiography, Thomas Hobbes said that his mother had given “birth to twins: myself and fear”, which might be taken as a very clear hint that Hobbes’s mindset was that of a very pessimistic and distrustful man. And yet, Hobbes was not afraid to voice his opinions on man in general and the organization of what he calls the Common-Wealth in particular with a frankness that does anything but bespeak of fear or pusillanimity at a time when to be frank on matters like these was especially risky to a person’s health. Nevertheless the pessimism and distrust of human nature mentioned above seem to be at the bottom of Hobbes’s whole philosophy, which makes a good case for the timelessness of his thoughts if you take them with the proverbial grain of salt.

Although probably not an empiricist in the strictest sense of the word, Hobbes is allergic to any kind of metaphysical malarkey when he claims that philosophy should be based on clear-cut definitions which will allow people to discuss both the natural and the social world in terms of intersubjective concepts. The prime sources of knowledge to him are our senses which are influenced by impressions that work on them via certain motions. How these motions are deciphered and interpreted by our senses, however, is a question Hobbes leaves in the dark. One of the methods he recommends in order to understand man, though, is careful introspection. So it is little wonder that Hobbes even comes to present the origins of religion in terms of psychological needs of man, as for example here:



This is probably one of the reasons why Hobbes is abhorred by so many full-time do-gooders and free-time mythicists all over the world: Hobbes destroys cherished beliefs and slams shut the door to cloud-cuckoo-land, and what he offers us instead might be neither flattering nor soothing. His view on man as motivated by self-interest only – which culminates in the will to survive – and his rejection of natural laws [1] granting life, dignity and candy floss as unalienable rights to every human being may insult human vanity – although they certainly testify to Hobbes’s awareness of the rules of the game of capitalism. That being said, it should be added that for all of Hobbes’s radical clear-sightedness he fails to acknowledge the existence of certain pre-state powers that pacify this dominant egocentrism of man, such as religion, [2] social codes of behaviour and arising from human interdependence, whose infringement is normally punished by peer pressure and ostracization, if not by more physical consequences. We might and should applaud this as the process of civilization.

In Hobbes’s view, however, the institution of a central government – no matter if in the form of a monarch or a group of legislators – is the only form of civilization, and this is where his ideas fall short. Hobbes’s failure to consider other socio-cultural sources of disciplining man’s innate egoism (by appealing to it via introducing severe disadvantages in case of anti-social behaviour) is the reason why he seems to bar any right on the individual’s part to resist the sovereign power once it has been established. Albeit he claims that the sovereign has the duty to protect his subjects’ lives and well-being, and he even appears to introduce a right to resistance by the back-door when he says



Here it is not said in so many words that a man may not disobey his government as such but at least he need not obey the law against his own vital interests – as Kant and others would later have it.

Of course, Hobbes leaves no doubt that the sovereign is exempt from any form of control or checks and balances, and he could by no means accept the concept of a separation of powers, and I am pretty sure that no one would like to live in the Common-Wealth designed and justified by Hobbes, or at least no one that has not experienced the insecurity of a lack of reliable government and of civil war. Nevertheless there is one big one has to do Hobbes justice for, and this is that he is one of the first modern European philosophers who had a utilitarian idea of the state and of government. According to him the state and the sovereign are neither God-given nor anything eternal and ethereal, least of all a super-organism, that makes the individual find the kind of sense he would never discover as an individual – you know, that sort of claptrap crap you would find in German Idealism. In Hobbes’s eyes, government and the state seem to be a necessary evil, something that has a practical benefit, namely to make the “life of man” less “solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.” (p.186) [3] Once this much is clear, we can discuss the state as a man-made commodity deciding on how much central interference we are ready to accept as necessary and how much control and individual freedom we would like to retain. It is in this sense that Hobbes is essentially modern.

All in all, reading Hobbes with an unprepossessed mind could, paradoxically, teach us to call into question the tendencies of governments and super-governmental institutions trying to educate their citizens and make them behave according to certain moral principles and operating with terms such as to meddle with people’s daily lives, forever introducing new regulations and prescribed terminologies, thus diminishing the sphere of individual responsibility and freedom.

17,Steven Peterson,"Three essential hallmarks of the Hobbesian system are important: the war of each against all, the role of human rationality in ending this; the use of knowledge/science as a basis for societal engineering. His view of the state of nature--that time before government and the state existed--is unsurprising when one understands that he was born in the year of the erstwhile invasion by the Spanish Armada (1588) and lived through civil turmoil and revolution in England throughout his life.

Hobbes begins with a view of human life that would be inconceivable to the Greeks--life in a state of nature, the time before government, laws, and the state existed. In this state, humans are equal. In terms of physical prowess, of course, some are stronger than others. However, the weakest, through guile, can still kill the strongest. In that sense, there is equality. Without the power of government to keep people in check, though, we find quarrels routinely breaking out. The motives are threefold: self-gain, safety, and reputation (or glory). The result is horrible, and here follows perhaps the single most well known statement penned by Hobbes: ""Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in a condition which is called Warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man. . . .In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continual feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.""

However, the fear and terror of the state of nature can be escaped. Humans are, after all, according to Hobbes, capable of reason. Individual reason leads people to realize that they must do something to escape "". . .Feare of Death; Desire of such things as are necessary to commodious living; and a Hope by their Industry to obtain them."" Furthermore, human reason allows individuals to understand laws of nature. This is defined by Hobbes as "". . .a Precept, or general Rule, found out by Reason, by which a man is forbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh away the means of preserving the same."" To preserve life, and the fruits of industry that might be gained by peace, human reason lets people realize that only by giving up some of their freedoms, liberties, rights in order to establish a system that will end perpetual war of each against all. The mechanism for this is the ""social contract,"" by which people in the state of nature covenant with one another to form a powerful government, so powerful that it can suppress individuals' efforts to seek self-advantage as under the state of nature. A ""Leviathan"" is needed.

However, if the state ceases to protect people's lives, the contract can be voided; revolution is an acceptable option for the citizenry then. However, the price is terrible, for with the dissolution of the state, people are plunged back into the nightmare of the state of nature. They would have to re-enact a contract to escape the ravages of the perpetual war.

Key points in Hobbes: the focus is on the individual rather than society, hence this is an individualistic system; human reason is considered to be central to attaining peace and harmony; humans can perceive the essence of natural laws through the powers of their reason; by contracting with one another, the people can control their destinies and produce an environment which they find more commodious for living fruitfully.

18,Xander,"In the Leviathan (1651), Hobbes builds on his earlier works to offer his contemporaries the solution to the horrors of the English Civil War: an authoritarian dictatorship. How succesful Hobbes was in convincing his contemporaries is beyond my knowledge, but I do know that Hobbes was treated as a black sheep even after his death. A huge part of this treatment has its origins in Hobbes' materialistic (and, according to contemporarties: atheist) philosophy, but I can't shake the belief that Hobbes' plea for absolute sovereignty was perceived as a threat to nobility and clergy alike.

I will not go into Hobbes' philosophy (see my earlier review of his 1641 book, The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic). Suffice it to say that Hobbes starts with a pessimistic view of man in nature: a perpetual war of all against all, with no place for industry and society. To end this horrible state of nature, mankind agrees to give up the right of defending themselves (i.e. using violence against each other) and collectively transfer this power to an absolute sovereign. This sovereign is absolute, in the sense that it has legislative and executive power.

There's a lot more to say about Hobbes' picture of the state, which I will not do in this review. To name just two examples, Hobbes seems to have the most confidence in an absolute monarchy - he doesn't seem to be a fan of aristocracy, let alone democracy. This is understandable: Hobbes had friends in high (royal) circles, who protected him from persecution by religious zealots, and maybe he was just plain honest in wishing the old pre-Civil War situation restored (England ruled by a royal family). According to Hobbes', monarchy is the most stable; but maybe we can have a different opinion in the 21st century, having lived in prosperous and peaceful democracies for more than a century. Anyway, I will not moralize historical works.

A second interesting point is that, even though half of the Leviathan is concerned with religion, Hobbes seems to attack Christianity outright. I'm not talking about his materialist philosophy, but about his view on power. Hobbes promotes dictatorship: the sovereign power (be it aristocracy, monarchy or democracy) decides what goes; the church has to obey. If there's a conflict of interest between church and state, good Christians should obey the state. In effect, what Hobbes does is transferring all church power to the sovereign - no wonder that most of his Christian contemporaries were furious!

How does Hobbes legitimate this claim? Well, we should dsitinguish between heavenly and earthly power. The sovereign (preferably the king) rules the earthly state; the church has only power concerning spiritual powers. A good Christian should believe in Jesus Chirst and obey the laws - and for Hobbes God's laws are natural laws, according to which the state is run. The church has no power over the sovereign.

It is hard to understand the importance of the Leviathan for modern-day readers: most of us are used to living in secular countries. But this is really the first major (historical) step towards a secular state; before Hobbes, there was no convincing philosophical justification of the seperation between church and state. This is a trend that later social contract/political writers like Spinoza, Locke and Rousseau would follow.

Leviathan is hard to follow at times, and in general seems outdated and abstract. It is an important historical document though. This makes it worth reading (maybe just some parts).


--------

On my re-read I feel like I understand Hobbes' train of thoughts much more thorough, especially the intricate connection between his conception of matter, man and state.

On a material level, Hobbes' materialism means humans are just that, matter in motion. He explains the passions as the impressions of external objects and internal states, deliberation as the train of passions before acting on it, and the will as the final passion acted out. On a higher level, the state is a Leviathan, a Sovereign with Absolute Power who translates natural law into civil law, and through this, guides society on a path to peace and prosperity. Leviathan, referring to the Book of Job, is a name well-chosen: Pride and Vanity are two of the most common and dangerous passions of Man, which lead to strife. According to Hobbes, the State is an Artificial Man, with its own particular organs, limbs, and functions.

It is still unclear to me what Hobbes' stance was on religion. His own doctrines seem to counter religious doctrines on fundamental points, yet almost half of Leviathan is dedicated to religion, and in pointing the Catholic Church to the notion that the Kingdom of God is still to come, (so their claim to Universal Authority over Kings, is misguided and deceitful) Hobbes uses countless examples and interpretations from the Scripture.

Interesting thoughts: his fulminating against the Catholic Church and the Scottish Church, as well as the Universities as the 'Kingdome of Darkness' with their muddled and deceitful doctrines. He destroys Aristoteleanism with the simple statement that this whole philosophy is based on concepts which signify Nothing. Essences, entities, essentialities, etc. are nothing but empty words - truth only houses in the method of resolution (analysis) and composition (synthesis): the breaking down of things into their parts and the building up of things from their components.

We see here, in Hobbes, the radical break with the past, as was happening at the time with Galileo, Descartes and Gassendi (whom Hobbes met on his various European Tours). And this historical fact, the epic and radical thoughts contained in Leviathan, its completeness and consistency, as well as its literary value - all this makes me appreciate Hobbes and his Leviathan all the more. I am glad I re-read it, so I can adjust my own perception of his philosophy and the book in particular.

19,Canon,"""But to what purpose, may some man say, is such subtlety in a work of this nature, where I pretend to nothing but what is necessary to the doctrine of government and obedience? It is to this purpose, that men may no longer suffer themselves to be abused by them that by this doctrine of 'separated essences,' built on the vain philosophy of Aristotle, would fright them from obeying the laws of their country, with empty names; as men fright birds from the corn with an empty doublet, a hat, and a crooked stick.""

Somewhere in the twilight zone of Hobbes' refutation of Cardinal Bellarmine's political theology in Book III, Chapter 42, I asked myself: ""Why the hell are you reading this? Your Bookish Persona is named Canon, yet must you read a Work Philosophical merely for its Canonical Estimation? Wait — why the hell are you, am I, talking like this?!""

Well, I can say I didn't read this in the spirit of Hobbes' desired-for ""sovereign who will consider it himself... and by the exercise of entire sovereignty, in protecting the public teaching of it, convert this truth of speculation into the utility of practice."" That is, from what I already knew of Hobbes's absolutism, I didn't come to it in search of a political philosophy to implement.

The catalyst to finally reading this behemoth (haha) completely was seeing Hobbes entertainingly pooh-poohed by Davids Graeber & Wengrow and James C. Scott (Affable Anarchists All) in, respectively, and . In a very different project (indeed, the aforementioned anarchists would doubtless have conniptions being placed in printed proximity with this next thinker), A.C. Grayling puts Hobbes in the anti-clerical movement of the Enlightenment in his book , which I also enjoyed reading earlier this year.

So there'd been a few references to Hobbes in recent reading, and my interest grew. But as a backdrop to this recent interest, I'd been wanting to read all of for a while purely out of my completist addiction, something I haven't yet gotten under control (help!). I'd read excerpts in the past, but the time had finally come for Thomas and I to take ""a pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,"" although no briny breeze was involved since I live, not on the coast itself, but inland on a peninsula.



- One of the most badass original book covers of all time:



- Hobbes's diabolical joy with his central metaphor of the state-as-body (or ""body politic""), and how he goes further, making the state not only a body, but a God. I appreciate the simplicity and insidiousness of the image. But Hobbes not only makes the state like an individual body, but elevates his own authority as the individual Theorist writ large in the State. Thus, I enjoyed reading this as a literary fantasy entitled

- Hobbes's colorful use of images and metaphors in general. One that has stuck in my mind is how Hobbes describes the warlike state of nature in terms of the tendencies of foul weather (this is near the famous nasty, brutish, and short passage).

- Hobbes' encyclopedic lists. I'm a sucker for lists, as my presence on Goodreads attests. Just look at this list. I enjoyed Hobbes's lists, lists in lists, and the appearance of exhaustive learnedness (but, in reality, idiosyncratic arbitrariness) they conveyed.

- Hobbes's nominalist apoplexy about ancient and scholastic philosophers, which I find completely agreeable, even admirable in its negative movement. Hobbes has Schopenhauer levels of sass about how absurd and idiotic philosophers he doesn't like are. For example:







- Hobbes's diatribes against the authority of the Church. Part III, despite its maddening length and morass of biblical exposition (that is, its appeal to reasons that I, a modern secular reader, couldn't care less about), persuasively argues that the Church should be subordinate to the Civil power, even though (a fatal flaw) Hobbes's Civil power is as tyrannical as the Church he attacks.

- Hobbes's obsession with demonology, the occult, witchcraft, ghosts, magic, gods, fairies, incantations, exorcisms, etc., as threats to civil society. Whenever he started in on beliefs in demons and magic, albeit to condemn it all, I lost all interest in his actual argument, and wished I was reading more about 17th century demonology instead. One of his most snarky metaphors (in a book full of snark and obsessively developed metaphors) is when he compares the Catholic church to the kingdom of fairies. Here's an example of the threat Hobbes sees in the belief in spirits: ""If this superstitious fear of spirits were taken away, and with it prognostics from dreams, false prophecies, and many other things depending thereon, by which crafty ambitious persons abuse the simple people, men would be much more fitted than they are for civil obedience.""

- Hobbes as an example of a thinker with with a no-nonsense, almost Lego-like realist metaphysics and epistemology of sense impressions — a solid block of a world that stands externally, like the Sovereign, as an Authority of the Common Denominator.

- Relatedly, how Hobbes's comparative philosophy is like levels in a video game —, let's say, where every world is built on the same Template or Reality and merely has interesting cosmetics laid over it to give the appearance of variety while there is really no difference or diversity. Hobbes understands the underlying Template and thus measures all cultures and societies by a single essential line, can (let's run with the silly comparison, just as Hobbes does) like Spyro the purple dragon empty these worlds out completely and make them sterile. At the end of his measuring line is Hobbes himself, the fullest, non-deluded teacher of Truth.

- How Hobbes shows the necessary interrelationship of Absolutism and Relativism, and that, within this dichotomy as posited, only brute power is decisive.



Against the many things I noted in the ""like"" column, let this outweigh it all: that Hobbes's admirable attacks on philosophical dogma and ecclesiastical authority are ultimately for the purpose of establishing an even greater tyranny in an absolute sovereign who has rightful control over all the thoughts and actions of its subjects, a power that can never be rejected, or ever criticized, and to fall away from which is tantamount to barbarity and damnation: ""And because the name of tyranny signifieth nothing more nor less than the name of sovereignty, be it in one or many men, saving that they that use the former word are understood to be angry with them they call tyrants; I think the toleration of a professed hatred of tyranny is a toleration of hatred to Commonwealth in general, and another evil seed, not differing much from the former.""",False,,,491,28,3.0,9.0,3.0,en,"""But purpose, may man say, subtlety work nature, I pretend nothing necessary doctrine government obedience?

24,Gary Beauregard Bottomley,"The Open Syllabus Project, the systematic study of over one million college syllabi ranks this book as the seventh most popular book cited by syllabi. After having listened to this book I know exactly why. The Age of Enlightenment starts with this book.

It's clear that the project of the Enlightenment was the dialectic of answering the pessimism of Hobbes with the optimism of John Locke. They might not have had to agree with Hobbes, but they had to respond to him.

Hobbes is very subtle in some of his arguments. The time period still believes in witches and superstition, and beliefs based on authority. Hobbes does not. The strength of Hobbes arguments is he understands what knowledge is, what absolute knowledge means, and how misleading 'belief in' and 'faith' are as foundations for understanding and explaining. Hobbes has an advanced way of putting the nature of knowledge on a firm foundation. Chronologically Hobbes comes after Bacon and Galileo but before Newton, and is laying a foundation for Newton to think of knowledge as Universal, Necessary and Certain for explaining and understanding the natural world. (Newton with his laws of gravity will see the world in those terms as will Kant, but Heidegger and Kuhn much later will show how knowledge is best thought of as particular, contingent and probable).

Hobbes is also not very subtle in some of his arguments. He is an absolute authoritarian when it comes to the power vested in the sovereign. I realize now why Richard Nixon in the David Frost interviews argued that the chief executive could not possibly break the law and why some would think the Nuremberg defense was reasonable (Hobbes would defend both). Even in all his muddle arguments sometimes real gems of wisdom pop out. For example, no man can be trusted when his job is on the line, or those who are influential and widely known are more responsible for inciting violence than those who are unknown.

There are two things I know with certainty: 1) everyone should listen to (or read) this book, 2) nobody should listen to the third chapter of this book (probably 8 hours long), the one on the commonwealth of the church. The third chapter had way too many bible verses and I would say that the Enlightenment ignored that chapter for the most part with one exception. I had just recently read the ""Age of Reason"" by Thomas Paine, and it is obvious to me that in his first edition of the book he took Hobbes chapter three and used that to show why the bible was not holy and he also directly restates Hobbes points about how revelation from God most always be second hand to everyone but the person who speaks directly to God. An aside, it seemed obvious to me that Hobbes was an atheist (or deist), but he never would be explicit about it. Though, in that dreaded third chapter (please skip it if you can!) he is really interested in showing why the ""papist' have less authority than the Church of England.

I really can't understate the obvious importance that this book has in the jump starting of the Age of Enlightenment. The book itself can be dry (and it is dryly read), but sprinkled through out the book are real pearls of wisdom. This book deserves to be the seventh most cited book on college syllabi. My only hesitation in recommending this book is the 3rd chapter with its endless bible citations. Don't skip the fourth chapter.

39,Cudetona,"“Deus Mortal”: dispensável ou necessário?

O Leviatã é um monstro marinho lendário, com aspecto de serpente marinha feral, descrito no Antigo Testamento. Suas características físicas variam de acordo com os livros bíblicos, podendo absorver a forma de um peixe, dragão, crocodilo ou polvo. Em “Leviatã”, de Thomas Hobbes (1588 – 1679), porém, esse monstro possui uma forma extremamente peculiar – e assustadora – de uma organização social, conhecida e chamada pelo filósofo por Estado.

O livro é dividido em quatro partes: A Respeito do Homem; A Respeito do Estado; Do Estado Cristão e Do Reino das Trevas. A terceira e quarta partes são compostas majoritariamente por análises dos textos bíblicos, e não precisam ser lidas por aqueles que não possuem interesse nesse assunto (por serem as mais longas e repetitivas).

A metodologia de raciocínio de Hobbes é, perceptivelmente, diferente da de outros filósofos do gênero. Ele trata a construção de argumentos de forma quase matemática. Para o pensador, a arte do discurso consiste em estabelecer relações lógicas entre os conceitos e definições, assim como no cálculo. Portanto, da mesma forma que um matemático pode se enganar e encontrar falsos resultados em suas operações, é possível também ao filósofo se equivocar e chegar em falsas conclusões. Isso ocorre pelo fato de que a capacidade humana de raciocínio é limitada, e qualquer pessoa pode se iludir em premissas erradas. Com esse pensamento, ele inicia sua longa argumentação com o que chama de “definições”: conceitos das palavras que serão mais recorrentes, para assim evitar ambiguidades e duplas interpretações. Para ele, discursos que não possuam definições ou sejam recheados de metáforas podem ser enganadores e não devem ser admitidos.

Com uma visão de coerção social antagônico ao de Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Hobbes acredita que o estado fundamental das relações humanas não é o de paz, como acreditava o francês, mas sim o de guerra. O Estado, portanto, serve para amenizar esses conflitos, e garantir a justiça, que o autor bem define como a garantia de cumprimento dos pactos. Isso se deve ao fato de que os humanos são movidos principalmente por paixões e emoções (e não pela razão), e a força das palavras é demasiada fraca para que os homens a respeitem por si mesma.

Para Hobbes, as relações humanas são regidas por chamadas “leis naturais”, definidas por regras que todos os homens devem seguir de forma a manter a paz. Assim, qualquer atitude que busque a guerra (por lucro, vingança ou reputação) vai contra as leis naturais. Essas regras se fincam na máxima da filosofia cristã: “Ame o próximo como ama-te a ti mesmo”, para que os homens se tratem como iguais. O Estado, pela descrição acima, seria a única forma de garantir a manutenção dessas leis por todos (existem soldados armados prontos para punir aquele que desrespeitá-las).

Existe, porém, uma razoável diferença entre as leis civis e as leis naturais. As leis civis são aquelas descritas por uma força soberana (mesmo que não seja monárquica), e devem ser registradas e interpretadas por assembleias ligadas ao Estado. As leis naturais, entretanto, são escritas por Deus e fazem parte da própria interação humana, e, portanto, não precisam ser anotadas, e são levadas como premissa em qualquer julgamento. Vale citar que uma lei civil nunca deve ser aplicada sobre a força soberana, uma vez que essa tem o poder de criar ou revogar leis ao seu bem entender. Dessa forma, qualquer súdito que possua o desejo de condenar ou acusar o Estado não detém tal poder, já que isso seria uma injúria a si mesmo e os indivíduos se classificam como autores de qualquer injustiça, pelo próprio fato de serem servos.

Em minha opinião pessoal, a maioria das conclusões de Hobbes são falsas, especialmente no que consta às relações entre homem e Estado. O Contrato Social entre súditos e soberanos é (na maioria das vezes) unilateral, fator que é completamente ignorado pelo autor no decorrer de suas argumentações. Além disso, discordo da existência de leis naturais, que, para ele, são intrínsecas ao ser humano, pelo próprio fato de que a existência de uma natureza humana é questionável com o advento da filosofia moderna e da psicologia evolutiva. Ademais, acredito que Hobbes não foi capaz de aplicar sua própria metodologia de pensamento para provar a existência de Deus ou de suas consequências (leis e direitos naturais). Isso parece uma contradição, já que esse tipo premissa não deveria ser admitida num discurso matemático.",False,,,5,4,3.0,4.0,5.0,pt,"“Deus Mortal”: dispensável ou necessário? O Leviatã é um monstro marinho lendário, com aspecto de serpente marinha feral, descrito Antigo Testamento. Suas características físicas variam de acordo com os livros bíblicos, podendo absorver forma de um peixe, dragão, crocodilo ou polvo. Em “Leviatã”, de Thomas Hobbes (1588 – 1679), porém, esse monstro possui uma forma extremamente peculiar – e assustadora – de uma organização social, conhecida e chamada pelo filósofo por Estado. O livro é dividido em quatro partes: A Respeito Homem; A Respeito Estado; Do Estado Cristão e Do Reino das Trevas. A terceira e quarta partes são compostas majoritariamente por análises dos textos bíblicos, e não precisam ser lidas por aqueles que não possuem interesse nesse assunto (por serem mais longas e repetitivas). A metodologia de raciocínio de Hobbes é, perceptivelmente, diferente da de outros filósofos gênero. Ele trata construção de argumentos de forma quase matemática. Para pensador, arte discurso consiste em estabelecer relações lógicas entre os conceitos e definições, assim como cálculo. Portanto, da mesma forma que um matemático pode se enganar e encontrar falsos resultados em suas operações, é possível também ao filósofo se equivocar e chegar em falsas conclusões. Isso ocorre pelo fato de que capacidade humana de raciocínio é limitada, e qualquer pessoa pode se iludir em premissas erradas. Com esse pensamento, ele inicia sua longa argumentação com que chama de “definições”: conceitos das palavras que serão mais recorrentes, para assim evitar ambiguidades e duplas interpretações. Para ele, discursos que não possuam definições ou sejam recheados de metáforas podem ser enganadores e não devem ser admitidos. Com uma visão de coerção social antagônico ao de Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Hobbes acredita que estado fundamental das relações humanas não é de paz, como acreditava francês, mas sim de guerra. O Estado, portanto, serve para amenizar esses conflitos, e garantir justiça, que autor bem define como garantia de cumprimento dos pactos. Isso se deve ao fato de que os humanos são movidos principalmente por paixões e emoções (e não pela razão), e força das palavras é demasiada fraca para que os homens respeitem por si mesma. Para Hobbes, relações humanas são regidas por chamadas “leis naturais”, definidas por regras que todos os homens devem seguir de forma manter paz. Assim, qualquer atitude que busque guerra (por lucro, vingança ou reputação) vai contra leis naturais. Essas regras se fincam na máxima da filosofia cristã: “Ame próximo como ama-te ti mesmo”, para que os homens se tratem como iguais. O Estado, pela descrição acima, seria única forma de garantir manutenção dessas leis por todos (existem soldados armados prontos para punir aquele que desrespeitá-las). Existe, porém, uma razoável diferença entre leis civis e leis naturais. As leis civis são aquelas descritas por uma força soberana (mesmo que não seja monárquica), e devem ser registradas e interpretadas por assembleias ligadas ao Estado. As leis naturais, entretanto, são escritas por Deus e fazem parte da própria interação humana, e, portanto, não precisam ser anotadas, e são levadas como premissa em qualquer julgamento. Vale citar que uma lei civil nunca deve ser aplicada sobre força soberana, uma vez que essa tem poder de criar ou revogar leis ao seu bem entender. Dessa forma, qualquer súdito que possua desejo de condenar ou acusar Estado não detém tal poder, já que isso seria uma injúria si mesmo e os indivíduos se classificam como autores de qualquer injustiça, pelo próprio fato de serem servos.

#Of Man#: No free will, no soul, we are just machines just like a ball on a slope, it falls down expectedly (it can't Will not to go down). Imagination is just Memory; decaying Senses that propagate inside our heads.

#Of Common-Wealths#: Read above-mentioned review.
-----

#Of A Christian Common-Wealth#: Now he links what he said in Of Man (the world and us are mechanical, no Metaphysics nor Ghosts etc) and what he said in Of Common-Wealths (submit yourself to the Sovereign and Obey him) with Christianity and that what he said is consistent with it.

As for linking with Of Man, his interpretation of Religion as a civil thing and not an ""organized/institutionalized religion"" is very interesting and consistent! Everything is mechanical/not-metaphysical. No Heaven and Hell, no Demons, no Angels (actually in new testament there are eternal creatures so called Angels but in the old testament Angel simply means God's action, he claims). But there is sorta soul and free will (it seems he means it here metaphorically, as in Church is like a living man), pp497 after his interpretation of church as Civil Council he says ""And in this last sense only it is that the Church can be taken for one Person [Sovereign]; that is to say, that it can be said to have power to will, to pronounce, to command, to be obeyed, to make laws...""

Jesus' second coming means he will be this Ruler, the Ruler of God's Kingdom, a kingdom literally! Heaven is God's Kingdom. The citizens of this state are called Christians. The Bible (according to Hobbes) says sinners die for eternity and they go to Hell for eternity (biologically everyone dies for eternity, there is no metaphysical Soul that lives forever). Hell is underground, as in the grave is Hell that people who died (for eternity) go to. Hell as fire for sinners is just what the Jews used to do, they had a big fire that they kept feeding with wood and was never put out, they used to burn Idolaters (Traitor to God's Kingdom, as in Traitors to the Common-Wealth) with this ""Hell"". All of this interpretation is backed up with references to the Bible and actually makes sense, if you believed in Hobbes' mechanical view of the World.

As of linking with Of Common-Wealths, ""submit yourself to the Sovereign and Obey him"" is what the Bible says about following prophets.

So for after-Protestant-Movement England (Hobbes was a Royalist, supported the King who established a separate Church [Church in the traditional sense]), this justifies getting rid of Pope of Rome, since England is an independent Common-Wealth, as in an independent Church [Church in Hobbes sense]. It's dangerous to have more than one Sovereign, and to have Churches [in the traditional/spiritual sense] leads to having a Civil Sovereign (the King) and a Spiritual Sovereign (the Pope), as in not-a-sole-power, which leads to wars as he shows in Of Common-Wealth. Now people who were governed by Abraham and Moses had these prophets as Civil-Sovereigns, who took Civil-Laws directly from God, thus these citizens are required to follow the scriptures (the Common-Wealth constitution written by God through prophets) since the scriptures were what these Sovereigns wrote as Civil-Law. Moses and many other prophets were both Spiritual and Civil Leaders/Sovereigns. As for citizens who live under Sovereigns that God don't speak to, they are ought to follow the Sovereign's Civil-Law whatever they are (even if they are inconsistent with the Bible), as justified in On Common-Wealth (Covenant/Social-Contract). Scriptures are to be strictly followed only when the Sovereign Canonize them (even then, the Sovereign is the one ought to interpret the Scriptures as he likes), Hobbbes gives an example of Canonized Scripture by the English King. When Jesus descends once again and becomes a Sovereign of some Common-Wealth, citizens are ought to follow him just like any other Sovereign (since Jesus is God, his Civil-Law/State-Constitution will be a new Bible too lol).

So my question is, are all people required to follow a prophet of God once they witness his Miracles? I'll try to link things together: as he showed in Of Man, that when you Believe in what someone is saying, it means that your Opinion of what he says is that it is true. As he says in Of Christian Common-Wealth, when someone claims he is a Prophet, only the Sovereign is allowed to Believe in him or not, as in approving his word as Law. If he did, then all citizens are ought to follow the Sovereign in his belief. They are not allowed to follow the prophet falsified by the Sovereign, justified by the power of the Covenant. If, as in the case of Moses, people were in a State of Nature (there was no Sovereign) they believed in Moses and made a Contract/Covenant to assign him as a Sovereign. But it's more complicated than that, Check Religion Tolerance below

I wonder if God sent a Prophet again and he had a Common-Wealth of his own, does Hobbes think people who are already under a Sovereign are required to follow him? It seems not (as I think, to be consistent with what Hobbes already said), by the power of Covenant (as shown in Of Man and Of Common-Wealths). So I think for Hobbes, Laws of Nature > Prophet (he explicitly says that Bible explicitly shows Jesus asking his followers to continue obeying their Infidel Sovereigns). He claims Laws of Nature come from God, thus it is God who is telling us not to follow the Prophet if we already gave our Natural Rights to a Sovereign (follow him Spiritually but not Civilly). To put it simply, you are not allowed to follow (Civilly) neither a Prophet or Jesus if you already have a Sovereign, because Prophets and Jesus are not your Sovereign, unless your own Sovereign approves (Sovereigns can do that, as in surrendering to another Sovereign) of them and make Covenant with them (remember that a Sovereign, as shown in Of Common-Wealths, still has his Natural Rights because the Covenant is made between the subjects and themselves and not between the subjects and the to-be-Sovereign). This is consistent with Moses (after he was made a Sovereign by the Jews) making a Contract with God.

So why Hobbes explicitly expresses his belief in Christianity? Because, as he said many times, that his Sovereign (England King) believes in Christianity and approves it. To be more precise, he is saying he believes in his Sovereign interpretation of Christianity (England King says do not listen to Pope of Rome for example). So does this make a reciprocal contradiction, that Hobbes follows Christianity because of his Sovereign but then he follows his Sovereign because of Christianity's ""submit yourself to the Sovereign and Obey him""? Of course not! Remember that Hobbes justified ""submit yourself to the Sovereign and Obey him"" in Of Common-Wealth philosophically then afterwards he mentioned Christianity just to show that what he is saying is consistent with it (that it is consistent with what his Sovereign believes). Technically, Hobbes system will fall down only when the Sovereign believed in another Religion (or just simply made a new Law) that says ""do not submit yourself to the Sovereign nor Obey him"". Or to make an extreme example (since the Sovereign has the power to interpret the Religion): When the Sovereign explicitly says ""you are allowed to follow more than one Sovereign"", Hobbes system will have logical contradiction (A=B and only B, A=B&C --> logical contradiction!), this is fun lol.

In conclusion, the Religion vs Common-Wealth (Civil/Politics) duality is dangerous. Secularism mutes Religion in Politics (takes it out of Politics and makes it a personal choice). Hobbes solution is to show that Religion = Common-Wealth (God's Kingdom = Israel) thus we no longer have the duality. No wonder they say Enlightenment came from the proper understanding of Christianity.

Also, his claim that Man'a Nature is Evil and not Civil (rules of the jungle, Laws of Nature), when Men come together and decide to make a Society, I claim that this assures Personal Rights for individuals. Aristotle claims Man's Nature is Civil, thus being born into a Society is the norm, which leads to not-assuring Personal Rights of Property etc. Hobbes harsh claim in fact opened the door for Human Social Contracts, as in: ""hey, you want me to agree to live in your society? Give me individual rights!""

-----

Religion Tolerance: Hobbes is saying that St. Paul is saying that man ought to obey his Sovereign even if he was infidel, man ought not to obey non-Sovereign Minsters of Christ. Ministers of Christ have no power to punish sinner or non-believers. But then, what if Sovereign bans Christian Belief? Hobbes said many times in earlier part and in this one that it doesn't make sense, a Man can believe internally in something but express externally something else. Sovereign has the right to decide what Religion is taught in schools and universities, he has the right to interpret Scriptures, he has the right to allow public worship of a Religion (or to be Tolerable to all Religions). But personal belief is technically protected, says Hobbes: You can't force what is in someone's heart. You can't open a Church if Sovereign says no, but you can pray in your home! So how to be consistent in obeying both God and (infidel) Sovereign? Hobbes (and Martin Luther) says Salvation requires only the belief that Jesus is Christ. So, whatever the Sovereign tells you to do, it can't be inconsistent with Christianity's Salvation, you don't need no Priest to confess your Sins to.

-----

#Of The Kingdom Of Darkness#: Hobbes gave his own Interpretation of the Bible that is so Materialist. He justified his right of Interpreting the Bible. He shows how false the Catholic Interpretation is. He then in this part shows from where this corrupt Interpretation comes from (from Converted Pagans, the same view of Catholicism is held by Muslims).

He also heavily attacks Aristotle Philosophy and Christian Universities for following it without understanding it (even if they understood it fully, it's still full of Shit). ""[Metaphysics] Books written, or placed after [Aristotle] Natural Philosophy: But the Schools take them for Books of supernatural Philosophy: for the word Metaphysics will bear both these senses. And indeed that which is there written, is for the most part so far from the possibility of being understood, and so repugnant to any thing to be understood by it, must needs think it supernatural""

Some non-Politics points:

We can't think without Language. From where did we get Language? God taught Adam all names.

Philosophy is Reasoning. It should be done Logically/Geometrically. It's ok to Reason about Effects of Cause, and the other way around, Causes of Effect (Deduction/Analytical vs Induction/Syntactical, I think).

Though ""Geometrical"" is the way Hobbes is following in this book, he used to support Empiricism (he likes Bacon and translated his works). But does Geometrism and Empiricism are necessarily mutual exclusive? I don't think so, Geometrism means to be precise with word definitions and to list your axioms then build only on them and to be Logical all the way (no Sophism), I think this is consistent even with Induction (stating your test data as your axiom then building on them). Remember he is supporting both Cause-to-Effect and Effect-to-Cause (unlike Rationalist Descartes who supports only Deduction/Cause-to-Effect, he even explicitly criticized Galileo's empirical Induction Effect-to-Cause work, Descartes too heartily supports Geometrism but only in the narrow sense).

So Hobbes says we can't Think/Reason without Language and that in Philosophy we need to be precise with our words' meaning, two points shared with Analytical Philosophy (from my 5-min research about it) which makes me even more eager to read their books. I wonder how Hobbes and Analytical Philosophy are close.

""In the power of making Laws, is comprehend also the power of Explaining them when there is need"", Montesquieu says otherwise with his Three Branches of Government Theory (USA Congress makes Laws but the Supreme Court is the one who Explains and Interpret the Law).",False,,,199,20,5.0,4.0,,en,"Read review first read book yet: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... #Of Man#: No free will, soul, machines like ball slope, falls expectedly (it can't Will go down).

It's dangerous one Sovereign, Churches [in traditional/spiritual sense] leads Civil Sovereign (the King) Spiritual Sovereign (the Pope), not-a-sole-power, leads wars shows Of Common-Wealth. Now people governed Abraham Moses prophets Civil-Sovereigns, took Civil-Laws directly God, thus citizens required follow scriptures (the Common-Wealth constitution written God prophets) since scriptures Sovereigns wrote Civil-Law. Moses many prophets Spiritual Civil Leaders/Sovereigns. As citizens live Sovereigns God speak to, ought follow Sovereign's Civil-Law whatever (even inconsistent Bible), justified On Common-Wealth (Covenant/Social-Contract). Scriptures strictly followed Sovereign Canonize (even then, Sovereign one ought interpret Scriptures likes), Hobbbes gives example Canonized Scripture English King. When Jesus descends becomes Sovereign Common-Wealth, citizens ought follow like Sovereign (since Jesus God, Civil-Law/State-Constitution new Bible lol). So question is, people required follow prophet God witness Miracles? I'll try link things together: showed Of Man, Believe someone saying, means Opinion says true. As says Of Christian Common-Wealth, someone claims Prophet, Sovereign allowed Believe not, approving word Law. If did, citizens ought follow Sovereign belief. They allowed follow prophet falsified Sovereign, justified power Covenant. If, case Moses, people State Nature (there Sovereign) believed Moses made Contract/Covenant assign Sovereign. But complicated that, Check Religion Tolerance I wonder God sent Prophet Common-Wealth own, Hobbes think people already Sovereign required follow him? It seems (as I think, consistent Hobbes already said), power Covenant (as shown Of Man Of Common-Wealths). So I think Hobbes, Laws Nature > Prophet (he explicitly says Bible explicitly shows Jesus asking followers continue obeying Infidel Sovereigns). He claims Laws Nature come God, thus God telling us follow Prophet already gave Natural Rights Sovereign (follow Spiritually Civilly). To put simply, allowed follow (Civilly) neither Prophet Jesus already Sovereign, Prophets Jesus Sovereign, unless Sovereign approves (Sovereigns that, surrendering another Sovereign) make Covenant (remember Sovereign, shown Of Common-Wealths, still Natural Rights Covenant made subjects subjects to-be-Sovereign). This consistent Moses (after made Sovereign Jews) making Contract God. So Hobbes explicitly expresses belief Christianity? Because, said many times, Sovereign (England King) believes Christianity approves it. To precise, saying believes Sovereign interpretation Christianity (England King says listen Pope Rome example). So make reciprocal contradiction, Hobbes follows Christianity Sovereign follows Sovereign Christianity's ""submit Sovereign Obey him""? Of course not! Remember Hobbes justified ""submit Sovereign Obey him"" Of Common-Wealth philosophically afterwards mentioned Christianity show saying consistent (that consistent Sovereign believes). Technically, Hobbes system fall Sovereign believed another Religion (or simply made new Law) says ""do submit Sovereign Obey him"".

41,Cybermilitia,"Öncelikle YKY'den çıkan Semih Lim çevirisini ben beğendim. Orijinalinden zaman zaman çarpraz okumayla gidiyorum. Kavram karşılıkları bana oturmuş göründü. Belki bazı fiil karşılıkları günümüz Türkçesinde başka anlamalara gelmeye başladı denebilir. Mesela ""Owneth""'ı ""üstlenmek"" fiiliyle karşılamış ama ""sahibi olmak"" daha uygun geliyor bana. Şu ana kadar gördüğüm en büyük problem, 16. baskı 129'uncu sayfada bir çeviri hatası değil de bir kafa karışıklığı.

Semih Lim sf. 126da 62. dip notta Actor'u Fail, Author'u ise Amil olarak karşılayacağını belirtmiş. Oysa Sf. 129'da orijinalde ""An Actor May Be Many Men Made One By Plurality Of Voyces."" ile başlayan paragrafı ""Bir amil, oy çokluğuyla tek yapılmış çok sayıda insan olabilir."" olarak çevirmiş. Burada Actor Fail olduğuna göre cümle ""Bir fail, oy çokluğuyla tek yapılmış çok sayıda insan olabilir."" şeklinde olmalıydı.

Amil-Fail/Author-Actor kavram çifti, kitabın ilerisinde sözleşmenin temellerine temas ettiği için -doğrudan onun üzerine de kurabilirdi- çok kritik bir yerde gibi geldi bana. Eğer Türkçesinden okumuşsanız, sizdeki baskılarda da aynı problem var mı? Daha önce okurken aynı yerde kafamın karıştığını ama ileride anlarım diye önemsemediğimi hatırlıyorum. Dolayısıyla 16. baskıya kadar devam etmiş olabilir bu hata.

Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı - Sf. 62 - ""Doğal ve sonradan kazanılmış zeka. Doğal zeka. Bu erdemler iki türlüdür, doğal ve sonradan kazanılmış. Doğal zeka ile, insanın doğuştan sahip olduğu şeyi kastetmiyorum: çünkü bu algıdan başka bir şey değildir; ve, bu bakımdan insanlar birbirlerinden ve hayvanlardan pek fazla farklı değildir. Dolayısıyla bu [algı, - Çev.] erdemler arasında sayılmamalıdır. Kastettiğim şey, sadece pratik ve deneyle, yöntemsiz, eğitimsiz ve öğretimsiz, elde edilen zekadır. Bu DOĞAL ZEKA esas olarak iki şeyden oluşur; düşünme çabukluğu, yani, bir düşüncenin diğerini hızla izlemesi ve belirlenen bir amaca doğru kararlı biçimde yöneliş...""

Burada günümüzde kabul edilen zeka formundan farklı bir form düşünüyor Hobbes. Zeka olarak karşılanan kelime ""wit"", kullanımdan kalkmış bir sözcük. Mental kapasite anlamına geliyor.

Hemen hemen şöyle bir form düşünebiliriz: Doğuştan zeka (algı) -> Doğal zeka (Naturall) -> Sonradan kazanılmış (Acquired) zeka. Bu bölünme bana ilginç geldi.

Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.81

""Bütün insanlardaki durmak bilmez kudret arzusu"" pasajı. Görünüşte belki Schopenhauer, ama daha çok Nietzsche'nin Güç İstenci'ni önceliyor görünse de, bu istenci basit bir ""ekonomide bulunan mekanizma""ya bağlıyor. Bu sebeple benim dikkatimi bu nokta çekti:

""Bunun nedeni, insanın halen elde ettiğinden daha büyük bir hazza ulaşmayı istemesi; veya ölçülü bir kudretle yetinmemesi değil; iyi yaşamak için halen sahip olduğu kudret ve imkanları, daha fazlasını elde etmeksizin, güvence altına alamayacağı gerçeğidir.""

Yani gözle görünür olan bu durumu, hem Nietzscheci Güç İstenci'nin, hem de Marxist Meta Fetişizmi kavramından çok daha zayıf bir mekanizmayla kolayca açıkladığını düşünmesi. ""Desire of Power"" diyerek ""Will to Power"" ya da ""Commodity Fetishism""i karşıladığını düşünüyor.

Tabi, gerçek örnekleri düşününce, mesela bir taraftan 7 göbek sülalesini kurtarmışların hırsı, diğer taraftan ahir zamanların en büyük patronlarının görünüşte de olsa parayla pek ilgili olmayan ilişkileri burada basit bir kendini garantiye alma mekanizması olmadığını gösteriyor. Bu örneklerin baya baya ""tarih yapıcı"" konumlarını da düşünürsek bu noktada tıkanıyor. Zaten kendi kalıbına uymayan arzuları delilik, kötülük şeklinde istisna ilan ederek kitabın çeşitli noktalarında kötülüyor. Ya da daha evrimsel bir çizgi izleyebileceği İbni Haldun'daki Asabiyet mekanizmasını da hesaba katmadığı/düşünmediği için ortalama, hatta sıkıcı, neredeyse tarih üstü, evrime kapalı, başka iktidar odaklarının rekabeti ve iktidar sahiplerinin yanlışları dışında değişme ihtimali olmayan bir yönetim mekanizmasına sıkıştırıyor kendi fikirlerini. Hem de Cromwell çağında.

""Hem de Cromwell çağında"" demek yerine ""Tam da Cromwell çağı sebebiyle"" demem gerekirmiş... gibi geldi bana...

Şu sıralar hala popüler bir örnek olması sebebiyle ""Rahatlık isteğinden, ölüm veya yaralanma korkusundan sivil itaat"" pasajında ""Chaos is a ladder"" tadında bir cümle geçiyor.

""Öte yandan, yoksul ve zorluk içinde bulunan, durumlarından hoşnutsuz kişiler ve, ayrıca askersel buyurma ihtirası içindeki kişiler ise, savaş nedenlerini devam ettirmeye ve nifak yaratmaya eğilimlidirler: çünkü askeri onur ancak savaşla kazanılır; ve kötü bir oyunu düzeltmek için de, kartların yeniden dağıtılmasından başka bir umut yoktur.""

Ne yazık ki, burada da toplumsal değişimi açıklayabilecek parlak bir mekanizma Hobbes tarafından harcanıyor. Eğer üzerinde daha fazla düşünmeye başlasa, ya da ileride anlatacağı iktidarı sarsabilecek mekanizmalar içine katılsa hem değişimi hem de yönetselliğin bu değişime karşı neleri düzenlemesi gerektiğine ilişkin güzel bir fikir olabilirdi. O dönem Hobbes'un etkilendiği diğer yazarları ya da zeitgeist'i iyi bilmediğim için bu fikrin ilk onda mı ortaya çıktığını bilemiyorum. Ama ilk çağ filozoflarında olmadığı kesin.

Bimeyenler için sahne şu:

Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.85

Doğru ve yanlışın ne olduğunun bilinmemesinden ötürü, geleneğe bağlanmak pasajında, Kant'ın Aydınlanma Nedir? metninden tanıdığımız bir metaforla karşı karşıyayız.

""Hak, hakkaniyet, hukuk ve adaletin nedenleri ve kökenlerinin yapısı bilmemek, insanı, gelenek ve emsali, hareketlerinde kural kabul etmeye yöneltir; öyle ki, cezalandırılmaları gelenek olmuş bir şeyin haksız olduğunu; ve cezalandırılmaması ve hatta onaylanması bir örnek oluşturan veya, bu yanlış adalet ölçütünü kullanan hukukçuların saçma sapan adlandırmasıyla, bir emsal teşkil eden şeylerin ise haklı olduğunu düşünürler; tıpkı, ana ve babalarından ve efendilerinden aldıkları cezadan başka; iyi ve kötü davranışlar için genel kural bilmeyen çocuklar gibi; şu farkla ki çocuklar kurallarına bağlıdır, büyükler ise değil...""

Yalnızca ortak metaforu (Çocukluk -> Olgunluk / Aydınlanma öncesi durum -> Aydınlanma) kullanmıyorlar, aynı zamanda Hobbes, Kant'a kadar pişe pişe, olgunlaşarak gelen bir düşüncenin ham halini ortaya atıveriyor.

Ayrıştıkları yer bu pasajın sonunda büyükler kurallara bağlı olmadıkları için ortaya çıkan ""işine geldiği gibi anlama"" durumu. Buradan Hobbes, büyüklerin işlerine gelmese geometri kitaplarını bile yaktıracaklarını, dolayısıyla kuralları istedikleri gibi yorumlayabildikleri konusuna geliyor. Kant ise o mekanizmanın büyükler için de işlediğini düşünüyor. Yani geleneksel kurallara uyumla aklı çalıştırma arasındaki gerilimi görünüşte Kant'tan daha gerçekçi ele alıyor. Bu nokta çokomelli... Üzerinde düşünmek gerek.

Düşündükten sonra edit: Tabi ki daha gerçekçi ele alır. Kant'ınki metafor. Yani bir tür modelleme. Sınırları belli. Hobbes ise doğrudan durumu anlatıyor. Zaten amacı durumdan vazife çıkarmak.

14'cü, Birinci ve İkinci Doğa yasaları ve Sözleşmeler Üzerine bölümünde Özgürlük nedir pasajında ilgimi çeken bir yer var.
""Özgürlük nedir. ÖZGÜRLÜK'ten, kelimenin doğru anlamıyla, dış engellerin yokluğu anlaşılır: bu engeller, çoğu zaman, insanın dilediğini yapma gücünün bir bölümünü elinden alabilirler; fakat, kendisinde kalan gücü, muhakeme ve aklının emrettiği şekilde kullanmaktan onu alıkoyamazlar.""
Burada Kant'ın özgürlük tanımıyla karşılaştırma yaparsak, özgürlüğü sınırlandıran herşeyi ""dış""arda düşündüğünü görürüz. Oysa Kant'ta içsel arzular, istekler de özgürlüğü kısıtlayan, sınırlandıran ketlerdir.
Ek olarak cümlenin sonunda Tinin Görüngübilim'inin Stoacılık olarak tasfir ettiği aşamanın izlerini de görmek mümkün.

Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.104
Temel doğa yasası:
Doğal olarak herkesin herşeye hakkı vardır.

İlk Doğa Yasası:
...herkesin, onu elde etme umudu olduğu ölçüde, barışı sağlamak için çalışması gerektiği; onu sağlayamıyorsa, savaşın bütün yardım ve yararlarını araması ve kullanması gerektiği ilkesi...
Yani ""barışı aramak ve izlemek"" ve ""bütün yolları kullanarak kendimizi korumak"".

İkinci doğa yasası:
... bir insan, başkaları da aynı şekilde düşündüklerinde[n], barışı ve kendini korumayı istiyorsa, herşey üzerindeki hakkını bıraklmalı ve başkalarına karşı, ancak kendisine karşı onlara tanıyacağı kadar özgürlükle yetinmelidir.
Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris: Sana yapılmasını istemedğin şeyi sen de başkalarına yapma.

Yoruma gerek yok sanırım... :)

Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.111-112

""Korkuyla yapılan ahitler geçerlidir."" fikri ile bir sonraki sayfada ""İşkence ile elde edilen suçlamalar da ifade olarak kabul edilmemelidir"" düşüncesi çelişkili görünüyor. Burada da ahit/sözleşme/söz kavramının Hobbes'taki merkezi önemini görüyoruz. Bir kere ahit yapmışsanız, onun gerekliliğini yerine getirmek zorundasınız.

Hristiyanlıkta ahit kavramı, Müslümanlıktan çok daha merkezi önemde olduğundan, yarısından fazlası İncil'in egemenler lehine nasıl yorumlanacağını anlatan bir kitapta bu normal sayılabilir. Eski Ahit - Yeni Ahit anlamındaki Old & New Testament adlandırmasıyla Okunan anlamındaki Kur'an karşılaştırması bunu veriyor zaten. Öykülerin gerçekliğine ilişkin son yıllarda büyük soru işaretleri ortaya çıksa da (Tom Holland - In the shadow of the sword etc.) Medine sözleşmesinin ilgası, Mekke'ye giriş, Hayber kalesinin fethi, heretik Şeytan Ayetleri anlatısı, ilk iç savaş da denen Ali-Muaviye arasındaki ihtilaf, ardından gelen İkinci Fitne de denen ikinci iç savaş vs ele alınınca ahdin defalarca bozulduğunu, bunun son derece sıradan olduğunu görüyoruz. Takiye kavramının merkezi yeri bile bunu gösteriyor. Bu nokta bence Hobbes'un anlatısının en kırılgan yerlerinden biri. Hatta Hobbes'un insanın yaratılıştan kötü olduğu, o sebeple denetlenmesi gerektiğini düşündüğü şeklindeki kent efsanesinin parçalandığı yer diyebilirim. Hobbes bariz insanların ahitleri onun anlattığı kadar önemseyeceğini düşünüyor. İnsanı dürüst sanıyor. Yazık... :p

Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.114-116

Tam bu ahdin tutulması noktasında Hobbes, neden verilen sözlerin tutulması gerektiğine ilişkin bir pasajla karşımıza çıkıyor. Adalet akla aykırı değil pasajında, adaleti doğrudan ahdin tutulması olarak betimliyor. Buradan yola çıkarak bunun bir doğa yasası olduğunu söylüyor. Niçin verilen sözlerin tutulması gerektiğine ilişkin temel argümanı şu:
Dolayısıyla, ahdini bozarak akıllıca bir iş yaptığını söyleyen bir kimse, barış ve savunma için birleşmiş hiç bir topluma kabul edilemez...

Dikkat ederseniz argümanda devlet yok, ruhani otorite yok, ki kitabın son bölümlerinde Papalık tartışmasında bu otoriteyi saymayacak, ruhani otoriteye erk veren Tanrı yok. Yalnızca barış ve savunma için birleşmiş toplum var. Bu argüman zaten devletsiz toplumlar hayal edenlerin kullandığı ana argümandır. Yani karikatürize edersek, Hobbes Anarşistlerden argüman devşirmiş gibi görünüyor. :)

Ayaklanma yoluyla iktidarı ele geçirmek isteyenlere karşı kullanabildiği tek argüman, başkalarının da bunu yapabileceği. Böylece tüm toplumu diğer bireylerle ilişkileri ikincil, atomize bireyler olarak ele alıyor. Ki her birey diğerlerini kandırıp iktidarı almak için fırsat kollayan kişiler haline geliyor. Sınıflar yok, ilişkiler ikincil, yani bireyler bir şekliyle büyümüş ve birey olmuş, artık ahidlerini tutması gereken birimler. Çok fazlasıyla modern hukuk anlatısındaki birey betimlemelerine benziyor. Zamandan, mekandan, evrimden, evrilmeden, eğitimden, aralarındaki farklılıklarından muaf, adeta tarih dışı eşit bireyler.

Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.104-123

Hobbes'un doğa yasaları olarak adlandırdığı ilkeleri listelemekte fayda var:
1-Barış ve kendini koruma
2-Başkalarının da var olduğunu düşünme, onların haklarını da gözetme
3-Adalet
4-Minnettarlık
5-Karşılıklı uyum ya da Nezaket
6-Affetmek
7-Öç alırken yalnızca gelecekteki faydayı düşünmek
8-Aşağılamamak
9-Kibirli olmamak
10-Küstah olmamak
11-Hakkaniyet
12-Ortak şeylerin eşit kullanımı
13-Kura
14-Ekberiyet (Yani doğadaki kura, ilk çocuğa daha büyük haklar verilmesi)
15-Barış için aracılık yapanların güvenlik içinde geçmelerine izin verilmesi
16-Hakem kararına razı olmak
17-Hiç kimse kendisinin yargıcı olamaz.
18-Kendisinde doğal bir taraflılık nedeni olan kişi yargıç olamaz.
19-Ortada başka ezici kanıtlar yoksa üçüncü tarafların tanıklığına güvenmek.

""...kendine yapılmasını istemeyeceğin bir şeyi başkasına yapma""

Bu liste bana On Emir'in inceltilmiş haliyle, modern hukuk teorilerinin ilkelerinin ilkel bir versiyonunun karşımı gibi geldi.

Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.133
Kitabın ana önermesi:
""Devletin Amacı, bireysel güvenliktir... Kılıcın zoru olmadıkça ahitler sözlerden ibarettir ve insanı güvence altına almaya yetmez.""

Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.134

""Tek bir karar verici tarafından yönetilmeyen bir çoğunlukla da sağlanamaz"" bölümü Platon ve Aristo'dan büyük farklar içeriyor. Burada sağlanamayan, ""bireysel güvenlik""tir.
""Çünkü, güçlerinin en iyi nasıl kullanılacağı ve uygulanacağı konusunda farklı görüşlere sahip oldukları için, birbirlerine yardım etmek bir yana engel olurlar ve karşılıklı muhalefetle güçlerini hiç mertebesine indirirler: böylece, sadece, birleşmiş az sayıda insan tarafından kolayca egemenlik altına alınmakla kalmazlar,; aynı zamanda, ortak bir düşman yoksa, bireysel çıkarları için kendi aralarında savaş ederler.""

Platon (Devlet / Devlet Adamı) ve Aristo'daki (Politika) çokluğun kararlarının azlığın kararlarından doğal olarak daha iyi, daha doğru olduğu şeklindeki akıl yürütme düşünülünce bu nokta baya problemli hale geliyor. İki ayrı ve zaman zaman sentezlenmesi gereken momentler söz konusu aslında.

Bu iki momentin sentezi için örneğin bkz. Roma Cumhuriyeti - Parlamento tarafından verilen Diktatörlük kurumu. Yani geçici süreler için, büyük bir probleme karşı çokluk tarafından yetkilendirilmiş birleşmiş kişi iktidarı. MÖ 501'den (Titus Lartius'den) MÖ 44 Sezar'a kadar 457 yıl iç savaşlar da yaratsa da ite kaka idare etmiş, bir sentez. Merhum Roma Cumhuriyet'inin yok oluş nedeni olduğu iddiasını naif bulmak gerek.

Lakin unutmamak lazım ki, Hobbes'taki eğilim günümüzdeki popülist diktatörlüklere eğilimin başat nedenidir. Bunu Machivelli'nin Fransız-Türk yönetimleri karşılaştırmasıyla birlikte ele almak lazım. O da bir sentez sonuçta.

Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.136
Kitabın adını da veren ana pasaj bu sayfada yer alıyor. Burada çevirmen ilginç bir şey yapmış. Leviathan'ı Ejderha diye çevirmiş. Oysa Leviathan özel bir isim, üstelik kitabın adı.

[Yani herkes ortak barış ve güvenlik için ahite evet dediğinde] ""Bu yapıldığında tek bir kişilik halinde birleşmiş olan topluluk, bir DEVLET, Latince CIVITAS, olarak adlandırılır. İşte o EJDERHA'nın veya, daha saygılı konuşursak, ölümsüz tanrının altında, barış ve savunmamızı borçlu olduğumuz, o ölümlü tanrının doğuşu böyle olur.""

Bu noktadan sonrasında Goodreads'in sınırları geldik.",False,,,102,22,4.0,4.0,,tr,"Öncelikle YKY'den çıkan Semih Lim çevirisini ben beğendim. Orijinalinden zaman zaman çarpraz okumayla gidiyorum. Kavram karşılıkları bana oturmuş göründü. Belki bazı fiil karşılıkları günümüz Türkçesinde başka anlamalara gelmeye başladı denebilir. Mesela ""Owneth""'ı ""üstlenmek"" fiiliyle karşılamış ama ""sahibi olmak"" daha uygun geliyor bana. Şu ana kadar gördüğüm en büyük problem, 16. baskı 129'uncu sayfada bir çeviri hatası değil de bir kafa karışıklığı. Semih Lim sf. 126da 62. dip notta Actor'u Fail, Author'u ise Amil olarak karşılayacağını belirtmiş. Oysa Sf. 129'da orijinalde ""An Actor May Be Many Men Made One By Plurality Of Voyces."" ile başlayan paragrafı ""Bir amil, oy çokluğuyla tek yapılmış çok sayıda insan olabilir."" olarak çevirmiş. Burada Actor Fail olduğuna göre cümle ""Bir fail, oy çokluğuyla tek yapılmış çok sayıda insan olabilir."" şeklinde olmalıydı. Amil-Fail/Author-Actor kavram çifti, kitabın ilerisinde sözleşmenin temellerine temas ettiği için -doğrudan onun üzerine de kurabilirdi- çok kritik bir yerde gibi geldi bana. Eğer Türkçesinden okumuşsanız, sizdeki baskılarda da aynı problem var mı? Daha önce okurken aynı yerde kafamın karıştığını ama ileride anlarım diye önemsemediğimi hatırlıyorum. Dolayısıyla 16. baskıya kadar devam etmiş olabilir bu hata. Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı - Sf. 62 - ""Doğal sonradan kazanılmış zeka. Doğal zeka. Bu erdemler iki türlüdür, doğal sonradan kazanılmış. Doğal zeka ile, insanın doğuştan sahip olduğu şeyi kastetmiyorum: çünkü bu algıdan başka bir şey değildir; ve, bu bakımdan insanlar birbirlerinden hayvanlardan pek fazla farklı değildir. Dolayısıyla bu [algı, - Çev.] erdemler arasında sayılmamalıdır. Kastettiğim şey, sadece pratik deneyle, yöntemsiz, eğitimsiz öğretimsiz, elde edilen zekadır. Bu DOĞAL ZEKA esas olarak iki şeyden oluşur; düşünme çabukluğu, yani, bir düşüncenin diğerini hızla izlemesi belirlenen bir amaca doğru kararlı biçimde yöneliş..."" Burada günümüzde kabul edilen zeka formundan farklı bir form düşünüyor Hobbes. Zeka olarak karşılanan kelime ""wit"", kullanımdan kalkmış bir sözcük. Mental kapasite anlamına geliyor. Hemen hemen şöyle bir form düşünebiliriz: Doğuştan zeka (algı) -> Doğal zeka (Naturall) -> Sonradan kazanılmış (Acquired) zeka. Bu bölünme bana ilginç geldi. Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.81 ""Bütün insanlardaki durmak bilmez kudret arzusu"" pasajı. Görünüşte belki Schopenhauer, ama daha çok Nietzsche'nin Güç İstenci'ni önceliyor görünse de, bu istenci basit bir ""ekonomide bulunan mekanizma""ya bağlıyor. Bu sebeple benim dikkatimi bu nokta çekti: ""Bunun nedeni, insanın halen elde ettiğinden daha büyük bir hazza ulaşmayı istemesi; veya ölçülü bir kudretle yetinmemesi değil; iyi yaşamak için halen sahip olduğu kudret imkanları, daha fazlasını elde etmeksizin, güvence altına alamayacağı gerçeğidir."" Yani gözle görünür olan bu durumu, hem Nietzscheci Güç İstenci'nin, hem de Marxist Meta Fetişizmi kavramından çok daha zayıf bir mekanizmayla kolayca açıkladığını düşünmesi. ""Desire Power"" diyerek ""Will Power"" ya da ""Commodity Fetishism""i karşıladığını düşünüyor. Tabi, gerçek örnekleri düşününce, mesela bir taraftan 7 göbek sülalesini kurtarmışların hırsı, diğer taraftan ahir zamanların en büyük patronlarının görünüşte de olsa parayla pek ilgili olmayan ilişkileri burada basit bir kendini garantiye alma mekanizması olmadığını gösteriyor. Bu örneklerin baya baya ""tarih yapıcı"" konumlarını da düşünürsek bu noktada tıkanıyor. Zaten kendi kalıbına uymayan arzuları delilik, kötülük şeklinde istisna ilan ederek kitabın çeşitli noktalarında kötülüyor. Ya da daha evrimsel bir çizgi izleyebileceği İbni Haldun'daki Asabiyet mekanizmasını da hesaba katmadığı/düşünmediği için ortalama, hatta sıkıcı, neredeyse tarih üstü, evrime kapalı, başka iktidar odaklarının rekabeti iktidar sahiplerinin yanlışları dışında değişme ihtimali olmayan bir yönetim mekanizmasına sıkıştırıyor kendi fikirlerini. Hem de Cromwell çağında. ... gibi geldi bana... ""Hem de Cromwell çağında"" demek yerine ""Tam da Cromwell çağı sebebiyle"" demem gerekirmiş... gibi geldi bana... Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.82 Şu sıralar hala popüler bir örnek olması sebebiyle ""Rahatlık isteğinden, ölüm veya yaralanma korkusundan sivil itaat"" pasajında ""Chaos ladder"" tadında bir cümle geçiyor. ""Öte yandan, yoksul zorluk içinde bulunan, durumlarından hoşnutsuz kişiler ve, ayrıca askersel buyurma ihtirası içindeki kişiler ise, savaş nedenlerini devam ettirmeye nifak yaratmaya eğilimlidirler: çünkü askeri onur ancak savaşla kazanılır; kötü bir oyunu düzeltmek için de, kartların yeniden dağıtılmasından başka bir umut yoktur."" Ne yazık ki, burada da toplumsal değişimi açıklayabilecek parlak bir mekanizma Hobbes tarafından harcanıyor. Eğer üzerinde daha fazla düşünmeye başlasa, ya da ileride anlatacağı iktidarı sarsabilecek mekanizmalar içine katılsa hem değişimi hem de yönetselliğin bu değişime karşı neleri düzenlemesi gerektiğine ilişkin güzel bir fikir olabilirdi. O dönem Hobbes'un etkilendiği diğer yazarları ya da zeitgeist'i iyi bilmediğim için bu fikrin ilk onda mı ortaya çıktığını bilemiyorum. Ama ilk çağ filozoflarında olmadığı kesin. Bimeyenler için sahne şu: Leviathan - YKY 16. baskı Sf.85 Doğru yanlışın ne olduğunun bilinmemesinden ötürü, geleneğe bağlanmak pasajında, Kant'ın Aydınlanma Nedir? metninden tanıdığımız bir metaforla karşı karşıyayız. ""Hak, hakkaniyet, hukuk adaletin nedenleri kökenlerinin yapısı bilmemek, insanı, gelenek emsali, hareketlerinde kural kabul etmeye yöneltir; öyle ki, cezalandırılmaları gelenek olmuş bir şeyin haksız olduğunu; cezalandırılmaması hatta onaylanması bir örnek oluşturan veya, bu yanlış adalet ölçütünü kullanan hukukçuların saçma sapan adlandırmasıyla, bir emsal teşkil eden şeylerin ise haklı olduğunu düşünürler; tıpkı, ana babalarından efendilerinden aldıkları cezadan başka; iyi kötü davranışlar için genel kural bilmeyen çocuklar gibi; şu farkla ki çocuklar kurallarına bağlıdır, büyükler ise değil...""

42,Matt,"To raise from his short, brutish existence man willing give up his freedom and rights to protect himself if others do the same to one strong man who promises to protect them. Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan revolves around this idea but leading up to it and expounding upon it is a surprising amount of insight of both political and religious thought.

Hobbes’ work is divided into four parts with the first, “Of Man”, covering human nature and why men form governments not for the greater good as other postulate but to protect themselves and their stuff. Hobbes essentially says that men give up their freedom to the government to be protected from other men so they can keep their life and possessions that they can add to. In the second part, “Of Commonwealth”, Hobbes argues that the perfect government is under one absolute sovereign—whether a monarch or legislative body—that will control all aspects of the government with the aim to preserve the persons of the governed by any means necessary and that the govern must obey the sovereign in all aspects of life including in religion and taxation, the later must be used to support those unable to maintain themselves. In part three, “Of a Christian Commonwealth”, Hobbes discusses how a Christian commonwealth should be governed and essentially says that the civil power is the final arbiter of all spiritual revelation and thus the religious power is subordinate to the sovereign as seen in the Holy Scriptures. In the final part, “Of the Kingdom of Darkness”, Hobbes turns his focus towards ignorance of the true light of knowledge and its causes which stem from religious deceivers through four things—misinterpretation, demonology and saints, the mixing of religion with erroneous Greek philosophy, and mixing of these false doctrines and traditions with feigned history. Hobbes blames all the churches and churchmen for these causes as they are the beneficiaries at the expense of the civil power which endangers the commonwealth and the preservation of every man in them.

As one of the earliest and most influential works on social contract theory, Hobbes’ political ideas are often cited and quoted. However, the fact that almost half the work is a religious discourse was a surprise and insightful. That Hobbes discredited church-led states was gratifying, though he then recommended state control of religion was a disappointment but not surprising given the theme of his work. Besides his views on the church-state relationship, Hobbes’ work is primary to understanding how the political thought of today began and how his contemporaries and those that followed him reacted to his views.

43,David,"Enter my crude understanding:

This very well may be the most difficult to understand book I have ever read, thanks in part to antiquated language, not having read Hobbes’ prior work, upon which a large portion of Leviathan is based, and a general bafflement at the immense explanation of terms and Hobbes’ immense, IMMENSE, dense, and convoluted use of theology and the Bible to attempt to rationalize (or, in the precise language of the book, ratiocinate) his view of sovereign power as being of higher authority than the divine. Hobbes is of the opinion that, in his mind, since the Kingdom of God is yet to come, we are bound by the laws of a (divinely appointed?) sovereign, using an extensively drawn out view that Moses was the first ‘civil sovereign.’ Even if the Sovereign is unjust, or forces one to renounce God, it doesn’t really matter (AND the Sovereign, being sovereign, is NEVER unjust), because as Hobbes points out time and time again, slaves are to be obedient to their masters and subjects to their sovereign. God will sort it out in the end, as He can see into the hearts of men.

Hobbes despises ecclesiastical power, and in particular, the Roman Catholic Church. Given the time period and the way the church exerted power at the time, I can hardly blame him. Ironically, this causes him to argue in favor of the idea of the absolute power of the Sovereign and the separation of Church and State power, as he has seen the abuse of the Church’s power firsthand (and unsurprisingly branded a heretic). I guess one of the fathers of secularism and western enlightenment just couldn’t get a break :)

I’m glad I read it, but I wouldn’t really recommend it for light reading. My interest lay into the relationship between the drafting of the United States constitution and the work of Thomas Hobbes. I can certainly see many direct sources of inspiration in the first half of the book. I can only imagine the horror some might experience if they knew that Hobbes’ self-interested and materialist commonwealth was thoroughly secular in nature.

And as we see in the water, though the wind cease, the waves give not over rolling for a long time after, so also it happeneth in that motion which is made in the internal parts of a man, then when he sees, dreams, &c. For after the object is removed, or the eye shut, we still retain an image of the thing seen, though more obscure than when we see it. And this is it, the Latins call imagination, from the image made in seeing, and apply the same, though improperly, to all the other senses. But the Greeks call it fancy, which signifies appearance, and is as proper to one sense as to another.

Where there is no common power, there is no law; where no law, no injustice. Force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues.

اللفايثان هو اسم كتاب لـ الفيلسوف الانجليزي توماس هوبز وضع فيه أساسيات نظرية ""العقد الإجتماعي"" في مفهومها الحديث. يعد من أمهات الكتب في السياسة وبالغ الأهمية خصوصا أن هوبز كتبه بعد ""الحرب الأهلية الإنجليزية"" كوسيلة لتجنب تكرار مثل هذه الحرب.

بداية الكتاب ابيستيمولوجية (الفرع المتخصص بالمعرفة في الفلسفة), أي يحاول الإجابة عن أسئلة مثل ما هي المعرفة أو الأفكار؟ ما مدى معرفتنا بشيء معين والحس والإدراك. وجدير بالذكر أن هوبز التقى بـ ""جاليليو جاليلي"" في إحدى رحلاته فأخذ عنه منهجه العلمي, فالكتاب متسم بسلسلة مترابطة من الإفتراضات وإستنت��جاتها المنطقية. حيث أنه يعتقد بأن علم الهندسة ومسلماته يجدر بأن يكون لغة فلسفية بذاتها, لأن الهندسة تجد ثباتها في مصطلحاتها المتفق عليها من الجميع, وبالتالي فإن البراهين والحجج المستنتجة غير قابلة للدحض. ومن هنا كان يرى أنه يجب أن نجد أرضية مشتركة ولكن هل صعب أو ""مستحيل"" المنال. لماذا؟ الجواب يأتي من هوبز, فهو يعتقد أن الطبيعة التي نلاحظها واحدة, ولكن بسبب الفروقات الجسدية والذهنية والعقائد والمفاهيم فإن كل منا يراها بزاوية مختلفة. بمعنى آخر, إختلاف التجربة يؤدي إلى إختلاف المعنى, وبالتالي لا يمكن الوصول إلى يقين.

ما الذي يرميه إليه هوبز؟ إنه يقول بأن الحقيقة لا يمكن أن تكون من الطبيعة, لأنها إعتباطية وتختلف من شخص إلى آخر وتؤدي إلى جدل. إذا الحقائق يجب أن تستمد من المجتمع. فهي حقائق لأن الجميع وافقوا عليها, فهي الخيار الوحيد. أيظا إستعماله للهندسة والمنطق وتأييده للعلم كل ذلك لأنه يريد الحقائق والمسلمات أن تفض جميع انواع النزاع والجدال التي قد تؤدي إلى ""حرب أهلية"" على سبيل المثال. يرى هوبز ان طبيعة الإنسان هي السعي الدائم وراء السلطة وأن هذا لا يوقفه الا الموت. أو الخوف من الموت أو الأذى فقط ما يدفعهم نحو الجنح إلى السلم. والأخلاق ما هي إلا المفاوضات التي تأتي ما بين السلطة والخوف لتحقيق السلام.

من الكلام السابق, توجه هوبز إلى التحدث عن الإنسان (ما قبل المجتمع) أو ما يعرف لدى البعض بـ (الحالة الطبيعية), ورغم أن الأمر إفتراضي فقط, ولكنه قال أن الإنسان عاش في زمن لم تكن فيه سلطة متعارف عليها لتضعه عند حده, فأدى ذلك إلى جنوح كل إنسان, ضد كل إنسان آخر, وهكذا انعدمت الثقافة والملاحة والمعرفة والمعمار والفنون والحروف والمجتمع ككل. والأسوء من كل هذا هو استمرار الخوف وتواصل الخطر من الموت العنيف. وحياة الإنسان سوف تكون وحيدة وضعيفة ومقرفة وبهيمية وقصيرة.

الخلاص يكمن في عاطفتين عند الإنسان وهما ""الخوف"" و ""المنطق"". الخوف يجعل الإنسان يحاول الفرار من هذه الحالة الطبيعية البهيمية. والمنطق يظهر للإنسان الكيفية التي تجعله ينجح في ذلك. اول نتيجة يستنتجها الإنسان هي, ما أطلق عليها هوبز مصطلح, ""قانون الطبيعة"", وهي قاعدة عامة أي أنها بعكس (القانون المدني) يمكن لأي إنسان الوصول لها بالمنطق والفلسفة. وأول قوانينها هو أن الإنسان يجب أن يسعى للسلام بقدر الإمكان, وإن لم يستطع فإنه يجب أن يستخدم كل السبل وبما فيها الحرب لكي يصنع هذا السلام. القانون الثاني ينص على أننا لكي نعيش بآمان وتحضر يجب أن تسلب منا بعض حقوقنا الطبيعية, مثل أن تقتل شخص آخر, عندما تسلب حقك هذا فإن الآخرين يسلبون حقوقهم في قتلك. ومن ثم يقوم هوبز بإستنتاج قوانين آخرى مماثلة تعتمد كل واحدة على القانون الذي يسبقها وهناك حق واحد لا يمكن التنازل عليه وهو حقك في البقاء أو الحفاظ على الذات.

ولكن على الرغم من ان قانون الطبيعة يسعى للسلام الا أن الطمع الإنساني للسلطة سيجعله يخرق هذا القانون مرارا ومرارا, لذلك كان يجب وضع سلطة عامة وذات سيادة وهي التي ستجبر الناس على الإلتزام بالعقد الإجتماعي أو القانون. ولكي تكون هذه السلطة ذات مفعول فيجب أن تكون إرادتها مبنية على إرادة الجميع وبذلك تكون هيئة خيالية, أطلق عليها هوبز إسم ""اللفايثان"" وهو إسم وحش بحري مذكور في ""العهد القديم"". أيظا صورة الغلاف هي تجسيد لهذه الشخصية الخيالية ""اللفايثان"". ويعطى ""اللفايثان"" السلطة المطلقة تجعله يفعل أي شيء يراه ضروري لحماية الأمة أو (الناس). جميع حقوق الأفراد أعيرت للفايثان, إلا حق واحد وهو حق الحفاظ على الذات أو الحياة لأنه السبب الأصلي لتأسيس العقد الإجتماعي.

رغم توفر ثلاثة خيارات, إما ملكية, أو أرسطوقراطية, أو ديمقراطية. إلا أن هوبز يفضل الملكية. لأن الملك في رأيه يمثل التجسيد الأقرب للفايثان كشكل السلطة ولأنه العقل الوحيد فإن قراراته ستكون أسرع وحاسمة, وأيظا إستبعاد نشوب حرب أهلية لأن الملك لا يمكن أن يختلف أو يعارض نفسه.",False,,,191,137,4.0,4.0,3.0,ar,"خلاصة كتبتها لأصدقائي على الفيسبوك, أي فهي ليست مراجعة أو ريفيو بمعنى الكلمة اللفايثان هو اسم كتاب لـ الفيلسوف الانجليزي توماس هوبز وضع فيه أساسيات نظرية ""العقد الإجتماعي"" في مفهومها الحديث. يعد من أمهات الكتب في السياسة وبالغ الأهمية خصوصا أن هوبز كتبه بعد ""الحرب الأهلية الإنجليزية"" كوسيلة لتجنب تكرار مثل هذه الحرب. بداية الكتاب ابيستيمولوجية (الفرع المتخصص بالمعرفة في الفلسفة), أي يحاول الإجابة عن أسئلة مثل ما هي المعرفة أو الأفكار؟ ما مدى معرفتنا بشيء معين والحس والإدراك. وجدير بالذكر أن هوبز التقى بـ ""جاليليو جاليلي"" في إحدى رحلاته فأخذ عنه منهجه العلمي, فالكتاب متسم بسلسلة مترابطة من الإفتراضات وإستنت��جاتها المنطقية. حيث أنه يعتقد بأن علم الهندسة ومسلماته يجدر بأن يكون لغة فلسفية بذاتها, لأن الهندسة تجد ثباتها في مصطلحاتها المتفق عليها من الجميع, وبالتالي فإن البراهين والحجج المستنتجة غير قابلة للدحض. ومن هنا كان يرى أنه يجب أن نجد أرضية مشتركة ولكن هل صعب أو ""مستحيل"" المنال. لماذا؟ الجواب يأتي من هوبز, فهو يعتقد أن الطبيعة التي نلاحظها واحدة, ولكن بسبب الفروقات الجسدية والذهنية والعقائد والمفاهيم فإن كل منا يراها بزاوية مختلفة. بمعنى آخر, إختلاف التجربة يؤدي إلى إختلاف المعنى, وبالتالي لا يمكن الوصول إلى يقين. ما الذي يرميه إليه هوبز؟ إنه يقول بأن الحقيقة لا يمكن أن تكون من الطبيعة, لأنها إعتباطية وتختلف من شخص إلى آخر وتؤدي إلى جدل. إذا الحقائق يجب أن تستمد من المجتمع. فهي حقائق لأن الجميع وافقوا عليها, فهي الخيار الوحيد. أيظا إستعماله للهندسة والمنطق وتأييده للعلم كل ذلك لأنه يريد الحقائق والمسلمات أن تفض جميع انواع النزاع والجدال التي قد تؤدي إلى ""حرب أهلية"" على سبيل المثال. يرى هوبز ان طبيعة الإنسان هي السعي الدائم وراء السلطة وأن هذا لا يوقفه الا الموت. أو الخوف من الموت أو الأذى فقط ما يدفعهم نحو الجنح إلى السلم. والأخلاق ما هي إلا المفاوضات التي تأتي ما بين السلطة والخوف لتحقيق السلام. من الكلام السابق, توجه هوبز إلى التحدث عن الإنسان (ما قبل المجتمع) أو ما يعرف لدى البعض بـ (الحالة الطبيعية), ورغم أن الأمر إفتراضي فقط, ولكنه قال أن الإنسان عاش في زمن لم تكن فيه سلطة متعارف عليها لتضعه عند حده, فأدى ذلك إلى جنوح كل إنسان, ضد كل إنسان آخر, وهكذا انعدمت الثقافة والملاحة والمعرفة والمعمار والفنون والحروف والمجتمع ككل. والأسوء من كل هذا هو استمرار الخوف وتواصل الخطر من الموت العنيف. وحياة الإنسان سوف تكون وحيدة وضعيفة ومقرفة وبهيمية وقصيرة. الخلاص يكمن في عاطفتين عند الإنسان وهما ""الخوف"" و ""المنطق"". الخوف يجعل الإنسان يحاول الفرار من هذه الحالة الطبيعية البهيمية. والمنطق يظهر للإنسان الكيفية التي تجعله ينجح في ذلك. اول نتيجة يستنتجها الإنسان هي, ما أطلق عليها هوبز مصطلح, ""قانون الطبيعة"", وهي قاعدة عامة أي أنها بعكس (القانون المدني) يمكن لأي إنسان الوصول لها بالمنطق والفلسفة. وأول قوانينها هو أن الإنسان يجب أن يسعى للسلام بقدر الإمكان, وإن لم يستطع فإنه يجب أن يستخدم كل السبل وبما فيها الحرب لكي يصنع هذا السلام. القانون الثاني ينص على أننا لكي نعيش بآمان وتحضر يجب أن تسلب منا بعض حقوقنا الطبيعية, مثل أن تقتل شخص آخر, عندما تسلب حقك هذا فإن الآخرين يسلبون حقوقهم في قتلك. ومن ثم يقوم هوبز بإستنتاج قوانين آخرى مماثلة تعتمد كل واحدة على القانون الذي يسبقها وهناك حق واحد لا يمكن التنازل عليه وهو حقك في البقاء أو الحفاظ على الذات. ولكن على الرغم من ان قانون الطبيعة يسعى للسلام الا أن الطمع الإنساني للسلطة سيجعله يخرق هذا القانون مرارا ومرارا, لذلك كان يجب وضع سلطة عامة وذات سيادة وهي التي ستجبر الناس على الإلتزام بالعقد الإجتماعي أو القانون. ولكي تكون هذه السلطة ذات مفعول فيجب أن تكون إرادتها مبنية على إرادة الجميع وبذلك تكون هيئة خيالية, أطلق عليها هوبز إسم ""اللفايثان"" وهو إسم وحش بحري مذكور في ""العهد القديم"". أيظا صورة الغلاف هي تجسيد لهذه الشخصية الخيالية ""اللفايثان"". ويعطى ""اللفايثان"" السلطة المطلقة تجعله يفعل أي شيء يراه ضروري لحماية الأمة أو (الناس). جميع حقوق الأفراد أعيرت للفايثان, إلا حق واحد وهو حق الحفاظ على الذات أو الحياة لأنه السبب الأصلي لتأسيس العقد الإجتماعي. رغم توفر ثلاثة خيارات, إما ملكية, أو أرسطوقراطية, أو ديمقراطية. إلا أن هوبز يفضل الملكية. لأن الملك في رأيه يمثل التجسيد الأقرب للفايثان كشكل السلطة ولأنه العقل الوحيد فإن قراراته ستكون أسرع وحاسمة, وأيظا إستبعاد نشوب حرب أهلية لأن الملك لا يمكن أن يختلف أو يعارض نفسه.",0.0,negative,191
48,Simon King,"When I read this book, I felt that it orbited around three categories: 1) painfully tedious, 2) fascinating and 3) scary.

Hobbes is fastidiously clear. Because his argument is about human nature, he spends around 100 pages defining what humans are and how they feel, sense and think. That part is tedious. Also, the last sections of the book, where he describes lawmaking, Christianity and ecclesiastical power, are also tedious.

I find the main crux of the argument fascinating, though. Without laws, and without a social contract that gives us equal rights, society degenerates into a perpetual state of war, which is the natural state of mankind. I find these bits fascinating.

However, dotted around here and there, you will find some really scary shit. The leader, 'the sovereign,' is above everyone else and has special constitutional powers. All his subjects must pliantly worship him. He is essentially no different from Putin, Trump and Chavez or even Hitler, Mussolini and Franco. Such a leader will guarantee law and order. The 'sovereign' of Hobbes' commonwealth appears to prefigure these autocrats.

It's clear why the book is such an important work. He presents a series of arguments for the necessary form of government that proceed more or less logically from his principles of human nature. I believe his conclusions are incorrect due to faulty first principles, not sloppy argumentation.

Hobbes' constructs his Commonwealth throughout the four parts of the book. The first part, ""Of Man"", consists of a description of people essentially as being entirely selfish and whose fundamental driving force is the preservation or acquisition of power. I think his views here are unrealistically pessimistic, but from this starting point it's easy to see why he advocated for such an authoritative government. In the second part, ""Of Commonwealth"", he builds on this definition ""of man"" to construct the form of government necessary to preserve the subjects against this aggressive human nature.

The last two parts are entirely focused on interpreting Christian scripture to establish the structure and limits of the authority of the Church within a commonwealth. I found these two parts felt like they could have been a separate treatise and were a bit of a slog to get through.

Bellum omnium contra omnes

Another book from philosophy class. I have trouble remembering whether this book or the frustrated the class more. This was a very ""interesting"" book to read. I think when people call Plato's fascist they are thinking more of this text which took all the controversial parts of Plato's political philosophy-cranked it up to 11-and made a fully sophisticated treatise out of it.

I thought for a long time that Hobbes was mad but when I read in which I learned about the politics behind the English Civil War (when this was written) this book made more sense. I still think it is extremist but it makes sense in context.

The point of this book is to convince you that people, while being free in the were base, stupid and untrustworthy and needed to be ruled under a social contract that saw the freedoms and rights of the people strongly put in a strong central figure or small group that Hobbs called the (specifically the as far as he is concerned). This was the only way to avoid a state of total chaos or that Latin phrase at the top of this review.
He felt that the population-at-large was to uncivilized and tied to there individual base desires to properly rule themselves and so there needed to be a sovereign that had complete power over the entire state to do this task for them.

Men in nature start out free and easy. Tom says that since men desire peace above all things (the first law of nature) they are to be willing to relinquish is right to have everything and ""quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris.""

I could give you endless examples but that is the basic point; a strong authoritarian government is the best way to protect and hold society together.

I think a good modern example of this working successfully (or at least the most successful example) is the People's Republic of China. That government fits the qualities of Hobbs' Leviathan down to a ""t"". It makes sense since had proposed a similar style of the Leviathan government years before Thomas Hobbs was born though I'm not aware if Hobbs used Confucius for reference since most of his near influence came from his mentor and patron who played a big role in the lead up to the English Civil War. But I think Communist China's...communist party has done a good job getting Hobbs' political philosophy mastered thoroughly.

I would check this book out to compare it to books like Plato's Republic and Aristotle's as well as which it is compared with and if you are interested in political philosophy in general check this book out.

69,Anderson Paz,"A obra Leviatã de Hobbes foi publicada em 1651 e se tornou um clássico do pensamento político. A obra, entretanto, trata mais do que sobre teoria do Estado. Hobbes se propõe a discutir sobre matéria, forma e poder de um Estado tanto civil quanto eclesiástico. O Leviatã de Hobbes quer o cajado eclesiástico e o cetro do príncipe.
Leviatã, para Hobbes, é um Estado artificial ou um Homem artificial que funciona para proteger e defender a sua própria existência, como também a liberdade individual. O livro tem quatro partes:
Na primeira, Hobbes trata do homem. Hobbes apresenta seu empirismo britânico discutindo sobre como o homem forma pensamentos, imaginação, linguagem, racionalidade, paixões, conhecimento. Ele também discute sobre virtudes intelectuais, objetos do conhecimento, poder, honra, comportamentos, religião. No fim da primeira parte, Hobbes finalmente apresenta seus conhecidos conceitos de estado da natureza vs. estado de guerra, contrato social, a relação entre justiça e leis naturais e o papel do Estado em garantir a liberdade individual naquilo que não proibir.
Na segunda parte, Hobbes trata do Estado. Ele discute sobre o surgimento do poder soberano do Estado, os direitos do Soberano, formas de governo e sucessão, formas de conquista, liberdade negativa, as partes do Estado, o papel dos ministros, o domínio do soberano sobre as terras, a relação entre leis naturais e positivas, crime, penas, recompensas, doutrinas que ameaçam o Estado, competências do poder soberano.
Na terceira parte, Hobbes trata do Estado Cristão. Aqui Hobbes apresenta uma teologia política em que o Estado tem importante papel na interpretação bíblica. Para ele, o reino de Deus é reino civil. Ele então trata de anjos, inspiração bíblica, profetas, milagres, igreja, direitos do reinado de Deus, o papel de Jesus. Hobbes entende que o soberano deve governar sobre a igreja e Estado e o homem deve obedecer o soberano para agradar a Deus.
Por fim, Hobbes trata do ""reino das trevas"" em que discute sobre potenciais ameaças religiosas à soberania do Estado. Ele trata de erros de interpretação bíblica, demônios e elementos pagãos na prática cristã, vãs tradições e filosofias e faz duras críticas ao papado romano.

70,Falk,"Hobbes's concept of the state and of sovereignty has been so influential that he can easily be called the Godfather of modern politics. (As could Machiavelli, with a slight twist of the meaning of the term.) This is also in that the absolute virtues (being also Hobbesian laws of nature) of peace and life (self-preservation to the degree of being totally risk-averse) of the Hobbesian bourgeoisie are so predominant in Western society today, that for a majority (possibly) of Westerners it is close to impossible to understand the thumos (spiritedness) that still has a prevalence within other cultures (and which in public discourse is often described as ""barbarian"".) - While Hobbes may be scathingly critical of contemporary Christian ""loftiness"" (not the least what regards the papacy and Catholicism), and endeavors to restrict all philosophical inquiry to the natural world, the sovereign power he sets forth is nevertheless biblically based (in this regard Hobbes is referring strictly to kingship). It can certainly be discussed whether his aim was to somehow reconcile science and religion, or simply adapt the latter to the former while avoiding accusations of heresy and atheism. - Though however materialist Hobbes's scriptural interpretation may be, of the four parts that the book is divided into, the third, on the ""Christian Commonwealth"" is by far the longest of them, though he also rails against ideas like ""incorporeal substance"" and ""immortality of the soul"", and includes a highly original version of the Trinity - an intriguingly heterodox blend in other words. - But perhaps it is more accurate to say that his view on religion (in statecraft) is , in the meaning that religion is a realm of life that any sovereign has to deal with decisively. This means that the sovereign (and certainly not anyone of the clergy) must be the authoritative head of the church.(See also for Hobbes's mature view on this and other issues.)

His formulation of the fundamental law of nature: (XIV) is described by him as well as a ""general rule of reason."" (Hobbes discusses reason at length in chapter V, defining it as ""nothing but reckoning (that is, adding and subtracting) of the consequences of general names agreed upon"" ... ""not but that reason itself is always right reason, as well as arithmetic is a certain and infallible art.."") Hobbes's fundamental law of nature leads to the second law of nature: (XIV)- Hobbes's only justification for war is self-preservation (preservation of the state vis à vis other states) based on the contract (covenant) into which the sovereign and the individual citizens have entered, wherein obedience (on the part of the citizen) is willingly bartered for peace and safety, of which the sovereign is the upholder and guarantor.

And the Hobbesian citizens willingly obey because the alternative is the natural state where (in what must be Hobbes' most famous statement) (XIII)
Leviathan (king of the proud) is the fix for that, and what is more: it is a natural fix; that men decide on a sovereign to willingly obey is also a (Hobbesian) natural law; for Hobbes sees natural law and what he calls ""dictates of reason"" as the very same thing.

Hobbes is a realist; there is no natural goodness in man, firstly because the state of nature doesn’t allow for that, but also because the definitions of ""good"" and ""bad"" will vary on an individual basis, according to our likes and dislikes,and so it is the both the prerogative and the duty of the sovereign to define ""good"" and ""bad"", and the problem of different opinions is solved by transferring all power in this area to the sovereign. Hobbes sees that every citizen nevertheless will keep their own opinions, but by each keeping them ""in their heart"", and outwardly obeying the dictates of the sovereign, this (natural) anarchy of opinion is restricted and regulated by the contract entered into. While Hobbes clearly has royalist leanings, his definition of the sovereign includes the possibility of a republican sovereign council, with identical powers as an individual sovereign, although he also sees the diversity of opinion necessarily to be found in a council as a likely deficiency in connection with the absolute sovereignty Hobbes envisions. In , Hobbes rails at what he snidely refers to as ""mixarchy."" ( Dialogue III)
Parts of would be exploited both by monarchists and republicans during the Civil War period, though as a whole, Hobbes work didn't really align with their causes.

, whichever way you look at it, is a masterpiece of political philosophy, and also one that still holds relevance. For example, the relationship between church and state is still a hot topic even today. Hobbes certainly does not advocate a separation of church and state, but rather a subordination of the church to the state. Add to that the fact that Hobbes is a major contributor to western political thought. This work is not only a fascinating read; the clarity with which Hobbes sets out his ideas, along with his masterful rhetoric, also makes a pure joy to read - and this is so whether you agree with him or not.

77,Charlie,"Carl Schmitt, a disciple of Thomas Hobbes, famously declared that all political theorists are divided between those who think that man is naturally good, and those who think him naturally evil. I sometimes think another binary would be more apt - one that classed thinkers into those who hope and those who fear.

Few sane men have ever looked around at their own time and thought, 'Yeah, this is fine.' Misery bites at the human heel with every step. Once upon a time those teeth were buried so deep in our bones that it seemed like the world would never change, that the only thing to hope for was a better life in the next (presumably better) one. Gradually, the human leviathan stepped forwards, the mad dog still biting at its ankles to keep it moving, and that feverish vision transitioned into a hope for a better future in this world instead. This transition is often referred to as 'The Enlightenment', though that's such a loaded term that no one will ever agree on what it really meant, when it happened, or what it stood for.

The important thing is that the world was never the same after the Black Death, or after Protestantism, or after the Chinese invented gunpowder and the printing press, or maybe after the first Peasant's Revolt made the underclasses wonder why kings kept killing them for making peaceful protests. Regardless, there is a nebulously defined window between the 14th and 17th centuries where something wild happened in European culture. Long before the Industrial Revolution turned Britain into an economic powerhouse, a transformation was bubbling beneath the skin. Well, a lot of transformations actually. Religious heresies, economic restructurings, the development of scientific methodologies and the 'discovery' of whole new worlds so fundamentally from the Christian/Islamic hegemonies of the late Medieval worldview.

This is the Early Modern World. To survey its events, its characters, its art, its philosophies and to draw from all this some kind of teleology is - to a certain kind of Left-Winger - one of the greatest pleasures of history, but it is history viewed through one eye only. Men and women living in this time did not see the rise of democracy, or the development of capitalism, or the wonderful powers of science and industry. They saw what little religious consensus their ancestors had lived under cracking as their neighbours took on heresies like some infectious, rotting mutation. They saw the invincible powers of kings and queens crumble and fall, and heard about all the sordid details with new kinds of theatrical dramatisations and printed news-ballads. They saw physicians grabbing the bodies of their dead to desecrate them, and when they appealed to magic to escape their misery, they were burned alive as witches.

This was a terrible world. Well, all worlds are terrible. Suffering is pervasive, but the point is perspective. A certain kind of thinker (let's call them a 'Whig') will look at the horror of their own period and think ""Dear god, this is awful. We should try and change things to improve our situation,"" and they'll consider the changes in the recent past as evidence for how successfully this approach can work. These are the people we have to thank for universal literacy, the vote, the NHS, and the invention of fire, but also the Great Leap Forward, The Holocaust, and millionaire celebrities singing 'Imagine' at the paupers. Some men's hopes do not deserve to come true.

The other kind of thinker looks at that same misery, and thinks to themselves, ""Holy Christ, this is awful... but it could be a lot worse."" They will then look to that same past, listen to the cacophonous howl of history, and ponder the blood-drenched labour that was required to get their culture to its current point, as evidence of why change is , or, at the very least needs to be handled slowly, lest the delicate edifice of what is laughably called 'civilization' come down like a house of matches. We have these men and women to thank for absolutely nothing. Their achievements are non-existent, they do not stop the clock from ticking, but feel proud of their fear as they sit comfortably atop the rotting edifice of time.

The Early Modern world was one of continual, and evolving, and multi-headed crises. The old ideologies were failing. Elites needed to adapt to survive. The poor were hungry, sure, but it was the middle classes you had to worry about. They were the ones who could afford files to sharpen their teeth. As kingdoms rocked between national uprisings, civil wars, sectarian violence and good old fashioned economic squalls, governments needed to find a new way of legitimising their rule. There are many fine and heroic thinkers who emerge in this time, not least of them being John Milton, who looked to ancient Biblical and Roman history, and fused what they found with contemporary ideas about power, faith, and knowledge. These are the characters who drew up Social Contract theories built on Republican notions of liberty and tyrannicide that - along with a whole host of religious and financial considerations too boring to describe - resulted with the British (or, more accurately, the British gentry) waging two separate civil wars and cutting off our king's head. It's remarkable that British nationalists are too embarrassed to celebrate that genuinely magnificent moment in our history...

Regardless, the heroism is one-sided. This was a miserable period to live through (though, as a rigorous pessimist, I must also reiterate that periods are terrible to live through, though some are definitely more terrible than others). Brother against brother. Father against son. Cromwell being a genocidal prick. You know the clichés.

And so, stepping through the storm like an angry prophet, his long lock's dripping with the gore of close friends, his sharp eye full of scorn, his high brow full of dark rage, we come to Thomas Hobbes.

Thomas Hobbes is a giant. He is a titan of political science. Indeed, he is probably the first person to have ever himself as a political scientist, imagining himself as a kind of Newton discovering the mathematical laws of power with a rhetoric imitative of Euclidean logic. Where that power could be understood through the practice of rhetoric in a process of artistic mastery over the subject referred to as ""Maker's knowledge"", Hobbes tried to master political theory by abstracting everything human from it. Starting with his famous declaration that all life is a mere ""motion of the limbs"" he suggests that our senses are ""pressed"" upon by the external world, so that even at a microscopic level the world is a constant struggle between bustling atoms violently exerting power against their neighbours. When even the tenderest touch, or loving glance, is cast in such terms, is it a surprise when the worldview that grows from this is one of perpetual war, of man against man, inevitably striving and struggling, suffering, and afraid?

But summaries don't do the man justice. His is a wit as solid as iron. A true genius, yes. A rhetorician of stunning ingenuity and literary power, yes. But you know what? Thomas Hobbes is also the greatest scaredy-cat that ever lived. He saw the maelstrom and he never wanted the world to endure anything like that again. So terrified was he of chaos that he was willing to sell everyone's freedom to a single monarch if it would keep things civil, and so he literally wrote the book on autocracy.

'Nasty, brutish, and short' - yeah, yeah, everyone knows about Hobbes' pessimism. Everyone knows that he is an authoritarian too. It's fashionable to call him the father of Totalitarianism which - well, considering Schmitt's admiration for the man - is probably true, but it's also more accurate to consider him the father of Liberalism, perhaps more so than John Locke. At the very least he's more . After all, despite what charlatans have been so keen to claim, Capitalists have repeatedly shown themselves to be perfectly happy with dictators so long as they can keep the plebs in order. At its heart, that's all Hobbes' monarch really is. A consciously false symbol arbitrarily imposed on a population to keep them in line so the rich boys can slurp up the spoils.

Yet what's curious about Hobbes is that he is the first theorist of the Powerful I've read who seems genuinely about wanting to make the world better. Power always has a legion of sycophants to call on, either to rebut criticism from abroad or salve their consciences in the face of blatant facts. Apologists come in many forms. Some are fools repeating other people's words, some are , whilst others are . One never feels the need to take their motives seriously because either they don't care and just want to make a quick buck from the establishment, or else they expect to be privileged by the system they're advocating, so any defences they make of hierarchy are produced in bad faith anyway. These men don't care about any society outside of themselves and they'll do or say whatever it takes to feel the slug-trail stroke of power patting the back of their necks.

Hobbes... not so much.

This is a man that managed to piss off .

Let's get this out of the way. Hobbes is a modern thinker. Not even Early Modern. . His style of thinking is more accessible to us today than any of his peers, which if nothing else shows that he was clearly onto something, even if it was nothing pleasant. His is a materialism that would make Nietzsche blush. His relentless amoralism would make Machiavelli cough and fidget in his stateroom. And his atheism...

Well, that's the question, isn't it? Does Hobbes believe in God? The entire second half of this book is a rather tedious - though definitely heterodox - slog of dutiful biblical commentary, quoting chapter and verse to prove why religion cannot justify sedition, but there's something about that abundance of words that feels like Hobbes is protesting too smugly. After so much sacrilege and cynicism at the start, he staples on an extra book's worth of chapters saying 'Look, I've close-read the Bible too!' even as he grumbles about silly university traditions, unjustifiable faith in prophets, and how much he absolutely the Catholic church for its ideological stranglehold over not-yet-secular states. Then again, it makes sense for Hobbes to try and develop an religious orthodoxy that will best serve state interests, so whether or not he believes in God, of course he'd try to dictate what everyone else should be taught to believe - or to believe in public...

Which brings us to the main point. Hobbes is a materialist on steroids. He refuses to even imagine spirits or ghosts unless they have physical dimensions, merely on point of principle that everything should fit into his overarching metaphor of 'geometry'. Everything must fit into this scheme and he'll be damned if even the imaginary spirits he doesn't believe in get to wriggle out of his frameworks. This emerges in his work as a stubborn refusal to treat other people's rhetoric seriously. When Hobbes talks about 'liberty', he doesn't talk about freedom of thought - indeed, he doesn't actually give a damn what people privately believe so long as they behave in public - he literally means the physical ability to move. To Hobbes, the 'liberty' of a river flowing through its banks or of a stone falling to the ground when unsupported or of a human being walking along a street to their job are all the same thing, and he consciously refuses to acknowledge anyone who abstracts that word into anything more meaningful. If you aren't literally in chains, you are free. Now shut up and get to work.

Like I said: Father of Liberalism.

And so Hobbes attacks rhetoric for obscuring rationality. He attacks the study of the classics for filling people's heads with silly notions of 'liberty' and 'tyrannicide' (indeed, he seems to blame the Civil War on people having read too much Epic Poetry... considering how frequently the English revolutionaries used to reference ), though it is nice of him not to ban them, instead just asking that they come with footnotes explaining why all these cool ancient heroes are actually bad men. Private conscience is to be done away with too - once a social contract is made, all decisions reside with the Sovereign, who should preferably be a single person, and if you disagree with a law then that's tough since ""the law is the public conscience by which [you] hath already undertaken to be guided."" After all, if people start thinking for themselves, then that means they're only obeying the sovereign when they agree with him, which is no different from not being ruled at all. Oh god, it's anarchy! Stop, stop! It's the Civil War all over again!

This is Hobbes at his most silly, yet it's also him at his most important. Power is his subject. Power is what he fears, what he desires to understand, and so, paradoxically, it becomes what he worships. He could still hear the cannons firing as he wrote these words - in Paris, yes, but justified revolutions have a tendency to spread - and so there is a desperate urgency to every step of his argument. Every barked command, every ornate metaphor, every bitter condemnation of free-thinking radicalism and sedition is scribbled by a hand still trembling at the artillery landing closer and closer to his window. Christ this man was afraid, and I think we do him wrong if we don't read him with an awareness of how traumatic the civil war was. There must have been days when it seemed like the strife would never end, that this constant bloodshed would be all the world would ever know. In such a climate, of course Hobbes would identify with his thought experiment of men giving up their freedoms to end his metaphorical war of all-against-all - anything, anything, to just stop the screaming,

It is that desperation that leads to Hobbes' most interesting argument, and it's not one that I've seen people pay much attention to, despite it being the key to his appeal. Hobbes' materialism is all encompassing - he doesn't have time for ideals, and he barely has time for justice, just peace. In that light, where other thinkers of the powerful desperately try to prove how such-and-such a ruler is just, or divinely appointed, Hobbes doesn't care. His social contract is little more than an arbitrary social arrangement put in place to stop us killing each other. At one point he even compares ""the laws of a Commonwealth"" to ""the laws of gaming: whatsoever the gamesters all agree on is injustice to none of them."" But as we all know, a game is built on arbitrary rules we agree to follow to give structure to some entertainment. Hobbes takes that logic and applies it to our . To him, our survival rests on an arbitrary set of social arrangements that we just have to stick to because even protesting them might bring us back to chaos again, and even the harshest autocracy (to his mind) is better than that. Stop complaining, he can still hear the cannons.

It is one of the classic, and most compelling arguments, of radicalism that a society instituted by violence is fundamentally illegitimate. If a bunch of Norman nobles came to England, massacred the English and divided their property amongst themselves, why can't the people later massacre the descendants who have inherited that ancient blood-money and take it back? 'Might is right' goes both ways.

Hobbes stares at this argument head on and doesn't even blink.



It doesn't matter how we got here. Keep your head down, play the game, know your place. It could always get worse.

Now despite everything, I don't want to be too harsh to Hobbes. This book is a brutal masterpiece, and I don't have the space to go into how it is to read, even when Hobbes is obviously wrong. His arguments are ingenious, his perspective disarmingly modern and forward-looking, and his rhetoric is just . Only Milton comes close to him in power, and Milton never had a passage where he took the piss out of the clergy by proving how they're like an international fairy kingdom kidnapping intelligent children to replace them with highly educated but parasitical dullards. Yeah, Hobbes can be funny. I'm as surprised as you are.

I went into this book expecting to hate this man. His reputation is so fierce. His influence is so vast. Everything he stands for is everything I despise. And yet... even when his pen bleeds some truly evil shit onto the page (see his callous attitude to witch burnings if you want to feel your blood run cold), I cannot help pitying the man. Watch him cower in the corner, flinching every time the grapeshot cracks. Watch him return to a revolutionary government he hates simply because they'll let him publish a philosophy that his own masters refuse to accept, so fervently does he believe in its importance! What a mind! What talent! You should have stayed away from translating Thucydides, poor soul.

78,Rachel,"I closed this book with an overwhelming feeling of finally. It took me six weeks of beating ten pages a day into my brain to get there, but it felt like much longer.

I definitely miss out in my self-induced philosophy reading from not having to really answer to anyone about it. I might skim and check out less if I had to write an essay about it afterwards, and I'll never really know how much I've skimmed because there's not a hope I'll revisit this book. The closest I come to reflecting (ugh, I despise that term) on what I've read is in writing this review. So it goes.

I did spend the first fifty pages wondering why this dry disquisition on grammar rankled with so many religiosos ... AND THEN! BOOM! It all makes sense to me; Hobbes doesn't have to twist himself in knots like, say, Spinoza, to introduce the Godly first cause he clearly doesn't believe in. I tried to raise the ghost of how startling and controversial these points must have been in the 1600s, but some things are beyond even my imagination.

""If this superstitious fear of spirits were taken away, and with it, prognostics from dreams, false prophecies, and many other things depending thereon, by which, crafty ambitious persons abuse the simple people, men would be much more fitted for civil obedience.""

Unfortunately for this hypothesis, the late twentieth/early twenty-first century proves that not to be the case.

""But because in sense, to one and the same thing perceived, sometimes one thing, sometimes another succeedeth, it comes to pass in time, that in the imagining of any thing, there is no certainty what we shall imagine next; only this is certain, it shall be something that succeeded the same before, at one time or another.""

Thinking be like that sometimes.

""For though the nature of that we conceive, be the same; yet the diversity of our reception of it, in respect of different constitutions of the body, and prejudices of opinion, gives every thing a tincture of our different passions.""

The mission statement of constructivism?

""And therefore such names [of virtues and vices] can never be true grounds of any ratiocination. No more can metaphors, and tropes of speech; but these are less dangerous, because they profess their inconstancy; which the other do not.""

Reminds me of the scene in 'Inside Out' when the train crash mixes up the 'facts' and 'opinions' boxes and the characters are like 'it doesn't matter, this happens all the time'.

""As, much experience, is ; so, is much science, . For though we usually have one name of wisdom for them both; yet the Latins did always distinguish between and ; ascribing the former to experience, the latter to science.""

Words matter!

""So that it is evident, that whatsoever we believe, upon no other reason, than what is drawn from authority of men only, and their writings; whether they be sent from God or not, is faith in men only.""

p44 OOF there it is.

""For let a man (as most men do,) rate themselves at the highest value they can; yet their true value is no more than it is esteemed by others.""

That's RAW, Tom.

""Ignorance of the causes, and original constitution of right, equity, law, and justice, disposeth a man to make custom and example the rule of his actions; in such manner, as to think that unjust which it hath been the custom to punish; and that just, of the impunity and approbation thereof they can produce an example, or (as the lawyers which only use this false measure of justice barbarously call it) a precedent;""

Haaaaaa. Also oof.

""And from this followeth another law, For otherwise the distribution is unequal, and contrary to equity.""

Early Marxist?

Regarding governments:
""[...] which for the most part are of those who have been versed more in the acquisition of wealth than of knowledge; and are to give their advice in long discourses, which may, and do commonly excite men to action, but not govern them in it.""
and
""Thirdly, that the resolutions of a monarch, are subject to no other inconstancy, than that of human nature; but in assemblies, besides that of nature, there ariseth an inconstancy from the number. For the absence of a few, that would have the resolution once taken, continue firm, (which may happen by security, negligence, or private impediments,) or the diligent appearance of a few of the contrary opinion, undoes to-day, all that was concluded yesterday.""

Oh look, it's a committee!

""When it is commanded, not the words, or gesture, but the obedience is the worship. But when free, the worship consists in the opinion of the beholders; for if to them the words, or actions by which we intend honour, seem ridiculous, and tending to contumely; they are no worship; because no signs of honour; because a sign is not a sign to him that giveth it, but to him to whom it is made; that is, to the spectator.""

This is a hot take.

""For it is with the mysteries of our religion, as with wholesome pills for the sick; which swalloewd whole, have the virtue to cure; but chewed, are for the most part cast up again without effect.""

This is the sickest burn on religion ... no wonder they wanted to burn .

""In like manner, if a man be metamorphosed into a stone, or into a pillar, it is a miracle; because strange; but if a piece of wood be so changed; because we see it often, it is no miracle; and yet we know no more, by what operation of God, the one is brought to pass, than the other.""

I love when I read something that is carved over with 'Terry Pratchett Woz Ere.""

-- The Damned, ""Neat Neat Neat""

The liberal instinct urges me to say that I disagree with it, but this book and its implications are bigger than me. I almost have to laugh at myself for leveling judgement on it, as if it mattered -- me: already living in the world of the leviathan. In the bigger sense, I don't disagree with it, anyway -- perhaps in the normative sense, but as an observer of society I see he seems to have his shit together. With my judgement out of the way, it's obvious that Hobbes didn't invent authority -- he's just a messenger after all, so no use blaming him for it. He illustrates and details the structure of power, the rationale behind why he would prefer a monarchy to a democracy.

Book one is where it's at. In a few lines, centuries ago, Hobbes dispenses with the main premises of childish political conceits -- the politics of the healthy and unburdened -- that still stink up the fringes of the political landscape: anarchism and libertarianism. As the title suggests, without some ultimate bully to enforce contracts between one party and another, there really are no contracts at all. Libertarian theorists invariably find themselves either defending an apocalyptic scenario where contracts are upheld between equal parties by personal or hired force (e.g. having lotsa guns), or they resuscitate the government they tried to bury under some pseudonym like ""the courts."" Never mind the fact that still other parties can't be expected to stagnate on the arms issue, or maintain a fair policy with regard to their neighbors. They will not have started equal, and they won't remain equal if they can help it. There will always either be governments or warlords.

Hobbes is a pious man, and so prone to getting caught in the tide pool of infinite regresses. What justifies one part of his argument itself needs justification, but none is to be found. Such is the case with the power of his beloved monarchy. Subjects get their rights from the king, the king gets his rights from god, and god, is, well, god (himself justifiable by the Socratic piss-take, the Cosmological Argument). Which is to say the authority of the king can't be justified at all. In a similar abuse of logic, geography, demographics, and chronology, Hobbes contorts himself to find the consent of the people for the king to do unto them what he argues is their own will. The king, he says, serves the will of the subjects, so whatever he does is, in a Nixonian kind of reasoning, not illegal or against their will. That, by his being king, well, his subjects have obviously agreed that it be so. Except that the majority of his contemporaries weren't consulted before his coronation; not to mention the generations to follow which didn't even exist.

What he didn't know was that it doesn't need to be justified. The subjects don't merely give up their rights grudgingly cowed into submission by some undeniable justification of divine right; they relinquish their rights and responsibilities deliberately, urgently, because that's what people do.

One point which surprised me was that Hobbes said the king's responsibility is to protect his subjects, and where he falters, so should the subjects' loyalty.

80,Matt,"Leviathan is Hobbes’ metaphor for the State.

According to Hobbes, the use of speech has four abuses. The second of which is when men “use words metaphorically, that is, in other sense than that they are ordained for, and therby deceive others.” Bk. 1, Ch. IV, pg. 17.

I’ll come back to this.

Hobbes is best known for his -life is short and brutish- quip which is a good summary of his first book. He does not hide his disdain for the Greek philosophers adopted by the church Schoolmen that came before him. However, the approach to his own political philosophy is simultaneously an imitation of, and rejection of, those same Greeks. Like Aristotle, Hobbes believes in the Euclidean process of defining terms which, when used logically, will then unambiguously reach to solid conclusions. Unlike Plato‘s Aristotle‘s or even Machiavelli’s , Hobbes makes no attempt, initially, to establish a State around some defined good. The State exists because men fear the state of nature in which all are at war with each other. The sovereign is a tool of those governed. The sovereign's empowered to help avoid utter chaos. All are bound to the sovereign because the sovereign is the expression of their will. And their will is a double-negative version of the Golden Rule- do not do unto others what you don’t want done to you. The values men have in a state of nature are given as inherent truths. Hobbes lists them off with a brief statement as to why with no debate. For example, “Riches are honorable, for they are power. Poverty, dishonourable.” Again, the focus is on what men are like in a state of nature, not an attempt to create new values.

Most people focus on the first book, but there are three others. The second book comprises mechanisms for the State. it’s not terribly engaging as it lays out reasons why monarchy is best the system of government and elaborates on the ways to avoid civil strife.

Then religion comes into play and the entire book loses cohesion. Any suspicions I had the Hobbes was an atheist were obliterated with the third book. Page after page of scathing criticism of the Church culminates in Hobbes’ reinterpretation of Scripture that:
Hobbes does not follow through with the idea of savage men bonding together in a social contract on their own terms to avoid living in a state of fear. No, Hobbes is really talking about Christians bonding together to enforce biblical commandments. The State and Christianity combine into one sovereign over the Commonwealth.

Overall, the first book is fascinating in its raw vision of humanity. The later chapters soften that image until Hobbes becomes nothing more than a theological reformer. The imagery of a monster State ruling over its subjects is not the image Hobbes is after. The subtle Christian reference to the Leviathan () becomes clearer by the end of the book.

The bill calls for a government similar to those of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Henry VIII, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire also known as The Hapsburgs. AD800 will re-establish true order since all men of reason recognize that a sovereign tamps down the natural passions of man. This is not a new government but the resurrection of ancient rule in which all rights of a monarch come bundled together because each right is inherently tied to the rest.

Furthermore, Hobbes, the unflinching champion of our cause, explains:



Our Crown's crusader means that freedom lies in the absence of laws and regulations. Hobbes understands the cold hard fact that man will always be in opposition against other forces, so, rather than fighting amongst fellow citizens, a monarchy will pull people together to operate and organize against a common enemy:

82,Cody,"Leviathan is really four books: ""Of Man,"" ""Of Common-wealth,"" ""Of a Christian Common-wealth,"" and ""Of the Kingdom of Darkness."" The first book is the philosophical framework for Leviathan. The remaining books elaborate upon the arguments presented in the beginning:
• ""Of Common-wealth"" discusses rights of sovereigns and subjects and goes over the legislative mechanics of the commonwealth.
• ""Of a Christian Common-wealth"" discusses the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Hobbes' idea of the Leviathan.
• ""Of the Kingdom of Darkness"" discusses false religious beliefs and argues that the political implementation of the Leviathan is needed to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.

Hobbes starts off by considering the motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. He depicts the natural condition of mankind as inherently violent, awash with fear. He claims the state of nature is the ""war of every man against every man,"" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Leviathan, a commonwealth head by a sovereign ruling head, through a social contract.

I can see Hobbes' influence in Locke and Hume. And while I admire the methodical way in which he wrote, in my opinion it is an extreme view to feel mankind is condemned with incurable violence or as Hobbes put it in Leviathan, a ""war of all against all."" And I disagree with his famous, oft-quoted statement that ""men's lives are solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.""

I believe Hobbes' analysis of human nature, like everyone else's, is a reflection of his own views of himself. While I would never underestimate the power of fear, as world leaders of history have used it greatly to their advantage, there is much to be said for human dignity and empathy. There is much to be said for love and compassion.

And like Nietzsche, Hobbes also goes out of his way to speak with an atheistic attitude, all the while seeming to give credence to the very thing he does not seem to want to believe in. One can not vehemently oppose an idea, if that idea does not exist. Fighting an idea only gives that idea more power.

Hobbes' Leviathan is far too fascist and totalitarian for my tastes and I prefer Rousseau's more positive view of man. Men's behavior is a reflection of how they are treated.

Hobbes' worldview is completely other from mine. His anthropology, soteriology, theology, philosophy, etc is another school from mine. I could address so many things that I find wrong with his worldview. I will touch just two: justice and Catholicism.
JUSTICE:
Hobbes defines justice as something defined by the sovereign. It appears to be something subjective, or to be more precise, although natural law exists, and a sovereign ought to follow it, there is no such thing as an unjust law. But if something cannot be unjust, can it be just? Is he defining justice out of existence? His attempts to cling to the solution of the sovereign for the brokenness of mankind has given birth to this conundrum. If we can object with the ruler, then we easily fall back into the state of war (or ""warre"" in his old spellings, which I loved). But isn't it very much possible that the one ruling will take advantage of his subjects? Oh wait, I gave up my rights when the sovereign came (rights which were basically unlimited before apparently), and anyways there is no such thing as justice without the sovereign.
So very odd. I liked Plato's definition better. And Wojtyla's personalistic norm.
CATHOLICISM:
Reading Hobbes's view of catholicism and the Church was very amusing, with his little pokes at Catholic practices and ideas, and his many misunderstandings of them. I particularly enjoyed when he countered Bellarmine. He would paraphrase B's argument and then give his rebuttal, which typical consisted of ""but that doesn't match this part of my already explained worldview so its obviously wrong."" I was left interested in reading more of Bellarmine's arguments for papal authority, almost forgetting about Hobbes's agenda.

""Produce thy hobnails, fellow daemons! He's about to enter—what delectable irony!""
------------------------------------------
is indeed a gargantuan monster, perhaps not in terms of its page count, but definitely in the terms of its design and content. Hobbes begins from the grassroots and patiently erects a most formidable edifice directly on the common green, casting a tenfold shadow upon the crouching humanity below. The view from terra firma is not pretty: the structure heeds no man in spite of being but an artificial construction, and while it must needs provide shelter for the adjacent villagers, it will by no means intends to bring welfare and happiness.

This building is Hobbes' Soveraigne: it has absolute power (either through general vote or foreign conquest), it brooks no sedition, it can pose as God's representative at will, it has no qualms in instituting censorship or waging war, it can freely choose its successor, it cannot be voted out of office - it simply holds an effective carte blanche. It was instituted for the sole reason of ensuring peace among the werewolfdom by any means necessary.

This institution is based on the social contract that people draw up in a desperate bid to limit each others' natural rights (to do anything to stay alive), and it can enact any laws as long as they do not contradict with what Hobbes termed the Naturall Law, which at first was broken down to various sections and ultimately summed up as the familiar Golden Rule. While it's not exactly clear how the eminent Soveraigne could be compared to others by way of employing the Golden Rule, one thing was made clear: since people endowed the Soveraigne with Its power, It cannot cause the commonwealth (Its kingdom) to be but the state of nature in disguise.

Living in the 17th century, Hobbes obviously had to take Christianity into account, and, even more obviously, he had to reconcile his Soveraigne's well-nigh absolute power with the eternal might of God - and to a lesser extent, the Pope. He did this through walking the reader meticulously through thousands of Biblical quotes wherewith he attempted to prove, through his materialistic lenses, that God was indeed the Almighty, but it shouldn't interfere with matters of the commonwealth (indeed, what is the sublunary life compared to the joyous hereafter!). The Pope, on the other hand, could hop it.

This in essence is the message of . But my flowery and somewhat flippant style does not do justice to the sheer scope and ingenuity of Hobbes' philosophical prowess. Contrary to ""the Schoolemen"" or the scholastics and other fans of Aristotle who held sway in the universities back in the day, Hobbes was extremely matter-of-fact and made a point of defining effectively all the terms he was going to build his monstrous arguments on. His definitions were clear and short, his train of thought steady and lucid, and his thoroughness accursedly impressive. He doesn't simply that that men are wolves unto each other and wave the Union Jack while declaring himself yet another philosopher king; he goes from laying out what concepts like ""will"", ""good"", ""honour"" and ""money"" mean, and from there he slowly builds up to enumerate the different rights the Soveraigne has, what is Its ideal form (Monarchy), what is Its relation to Its various subjects like ministers, traders and clergymen etc.

In the two final chapters, which comprise more than half of the book, he puts forth a very credible interpretation of the Scriptures, taking a consistent stance that most of the things should be read as parables. It's no wonder that he was accused of atheism back in the day (though I don't personally believe that anyone so well-versed and reverent towards the Bible could be considered a heretic): he hints that God is material, that the circular logic of Bible's authority being proclaimed within the book is an absolute fact that should be lived with, he insists that Satan should never have been left untranslated and hinted that he is a personality and not simply a random enemy, he finds no evidence for everlasting death, he negates most special rights interpreted being invested in the Apostles, he differentiates between Kingdom of God (on Earth) and Kingdom of Christ (in heaven), he refutes the idea of an eternal afterlife in heaven (it being rather in the Kingdom of God) and he asserts that only Soveraigne's can be considered prophets, and that international ecclesiastical institutions are not Biblically justified. In the same breath, he chastises idolising of old authorities like Aristotle, and more or less squashes both Hellenic classics and pontifical champions. Hobbes was quite a piece of work, yet I think it should be noted that he was not simply a power-hungry tyrant in breeches: throughout the work it becomes apparent (at least to me) that he was both led by the extraordinary lucidity of his logic (as all great men are) and greatly influenced by his desperate desire for law and order, in the midst of the bloody British scuffles of the 17th century.

Now, I'm not going to spend too much time on pointing out the weaknesses in Hobbes' exposition. It is obvious that a totalitarian leader cannot quell and, indeed, even incites dissent, especially if he was chosen by the majority only and not the entire people. It is also a very questionable point as to allow the Soveraigne to choose their successor simply by referring to the will of the people who instituted the Soveraigne in the first place - unlike what Hobbes thought, it's by no means crystal clear that the coming generations are equally chuffed at such a honcho. And what can we say about a power that can institute an absolute ruler yet cannot abrogate such an institution?

So I'm not at all in favour of what Hobbes suggests herein, yet that doesn't mean this book isn't a tremendously good treatise on power and politics. Its inspirational scope gives much food for thought, and the way it is constructed influenced me to a certain extent. I personally think that Hobbes was right about the underlining idea of a society, that is, to ensure peace first and foremost, and so it's fascinating to ponder to what an extent can his Soveraigne's interference be justified today in the form of a democratic government. At this stage, I have nothing but questions and eyes full of wonder, yet it's clear that Hobbes has both inspired and terrified me.

Finally, even though the modern times do not really use as a model of governance, one question remains empathic after all these centuries: ""If Hobbes is even partially right on the nature of Man, to what an extent are his ideas advisable?""",False,,,318,37,4.0,1.0,,en,"The first, generall distribution Punishments, Divine, Humane.

Hobbes was like, ""People, people - basically this Leviathan already exists! I'm just trying to describe it better, so we can deal with it and perfect it more fully."" People were like, ""Hobbes, you maniac! We don't want a LEVIATHAN!""

Written during the English Reformation, Hobbes was confronted with the problem of absolute individualism; he begins this work of political theory with a demolishment of objective truth swift enough to impress any post-modernist. He then proceeds to demonstrate the logical conclusion of man in a state of nature, and compels the modern world to enter into his social contract, or Leviathan out of necessity and fear. It is tempting to write off Hobbes as a cynic, but who can deny that much of what motivates individuals in the modern world is simply a fear to maintain survival and acceptance.

Hobbes, on the other hand, has little to do with the structure of the state, choosing to write almost exclusively about how necessary it is, given the dangers of anarchy and civil war.
And he does so not in a simple and directl manner, but losing himself in apologetic theological digressions of the Anglican Reformation.

99,Carol Apple,"Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil was one of my more difficult reading experiences, but well worth the effort. The text is not hard to understand; although dense, Hobbes' writing is smooth as silk and interlaced with a subtle dry wit. I found the 17th century English to be an unexpected delight. For me the drollness of it is perfect for understated humor.

The difficult part is that I am highly resistant to the case Hobbes is making: the case for a highly authoritarian form of government, preferably a hereditary monarchy. I have always hated the idea of authoritarian government let alone monarchy and after reading I still don't care for it. However I must admit I can see where Hobbes is coming from. This book demonstrated to me that, with intelligence, reasoning skills, and a dash of dry humor, you can make a strong case for pretty much anything.

is considered by scholars to be the foundational work of modern political theory. Published in 1651, it was innovative, original, and it laid groundwork for the social science of politics and the framing of concepts such as ""social contract"". Hobbes employs persuasive reason to explore the source and limits of state authority. It breaks down barriers of thought, punctures assumptions, and most of all dares to challenge the authority of the church. Yes, the authority of the church was challenged before Hobbes - e.g. Henry VIII, Martin Luther, and most, relevantly, Oliver Cromwell. But Hobbes goes further and explains point by point why the church does not have authority at all in this world and how it has misinterpreted scripture to its own advantage.

Hobbes was apparently a peace-loving soul and a gifted scholar. He was born in 1588 I'm Malmesbury, right about the time England was having the conflict with the Spanish Armada. There is a story is that he was born prematurely because his mother (whose name nobody knows) took fright when she heard about the approaching Armada. When he was very young, his clergyman father was disgraced by a fight with another vicar and was forced to leave the family. Thomas and his brother and sister ended up being raised by an unmarried uncle.

Not much more is known about his childhood except that he received an excellent education and showed early signed of being a promising scholar. His first post-college jog was as a tutor for the son of a wealthy family named Cavindish. This family became his sponsor and protector throughout his life – and as his life included some violent political times, that protection may have preserved his life. He worked as a tutor off and on throughout his long life, even for a short time tutoring the Prince of Wales, a gig that seems to have benefitted him in his old age when the Prince of Wales became King Charles II. In middle age he lived through the English Civil War in which Charles I was dethroned by the Oliver Cromwell party. Hobbes heard about the king’s beheading from an eye witness and was much upset by that event as well as the civil unrest and crazed violence of the period.

I have read conflicting accounts of how the English Civil War may or may not have inspired Hobbes to write . From what I can discern he had already thought out much of his political theory years before the war broke out, writing several treatises on aspects of it, but perhaps the war, the loss of a good friend in the violence, and the beheading of the king intensified his efforts to get the book into print. The book, published in 1651, caused quite an uproar and offended pretty much all parties. That in itself is an indicator of a must-read!

You’d think at least the Royalists would love the book since it is an unapologetic defense of a powerful monarchy. But no. Apparently some of them wanted to kill the author. Some of the Royalists were Catholic and the book absolutely skewers the Catholic Church. Others were Anglican and the book is not flattering to them either. Also, despite his apparent support for monarchy, in an underhanded way Hobbes makes the point that the sovereign reigns only at the consent of the people and has certain obligations under the social contract. This was a big departure from the idea that the king’s authority comes straight from God - an idea known at the divine right of kings.

The idea of a social contract between the sovereign and the subjects had been around long before Hobbes, but he redefined it and presented a radical new theory about how it works in mechanistic terms and why it is necessary to the wellbeing of humanity. Hobbes calls the Government or state led by a sovereign a , a concept he got from the . He calls the leviathan state “an artificial man” with an artificial body, the sovereign being the head, that serves to protect humans from a much more horrible alternative: living in the state of nature. In explaining his idea of the state of nature, Hobbes writes the passage he is most famous for:

You just can’t write a review of Leviathan without quoting that. Hobbes goes on for quite some time in this section explaining how in a state of nature humans live in a constant state of war or fear of war. Nothing is illegal and therefore life is a big free-for-all of taking and killing to benefit yourself and your tribe. He does not blame mankind for this. We can’t help what we are, but the sooner we face the fact that humans are incapable of living in happy peace without a strong government, the sooner we will be able to live happily within the necessities of the artificial world created by civil government.

The book has a scientific materialistic secular tone that continues to offend today. Hobbes says he cannot imagine anything really existing without a body or an objective existence. Dreams and ghosts are result of imagination deriving from a physical origin working on the internal parts of the brain. They have no reality. And yet the Catholic Church has found many ways to use supposed spiritual beings to control people and gain money. I am no materialist, but you cannot deny history. Hobbes make much of Jesus’ words “My kingdom is not of this world.”

In fact, half the book makes his case from biblical scriptures. Which is kind of funny, because scholars say Hobbes was either an atheist, an agnostic, or a deist. From my reading of Leviathan my guess is deist. I suppose the Bible had such a hold on the people of the time, that he wants to show that even the Bible supports his case. As a scholar he knows his Bible deeply and thoroughly, quoting extensively from both the Old and New Testaments. It’s a good thing I have read Tolstoy and Walter Wink, who show how the Bible supports civil disobedience and anarchy. Otherwise I might have fallen for Hobbe’s arguments. (Read widely folks. I am middle aged and my horizons are still widening with every book I read, and I know I have far to go before I can form any definite conclusion. I am beginning to think that such conclusion will have to wait until I have spent a couple thousand years in the great library in the sky.)

is divided into three parts called, , and . Part Three, the longest, is where Hobbes takes on the Catholic Church and religion in general, making full use of the Bible to make his case. He spends a lot of time explaining why the Pope and a state sovereign cannot share power. A leviathan cannot have two heads. But what if the king commands you to to do something against your conscience or the laws of your religion such as worship himself as as a god? Then, says Hobbes, worship the king as a god:



The positive side of Hobbes is that he is all about the preservation of life. The goal of his civil arrangement is that as many people as possible might live a good long reasonably content life — avoid an early death after a nasty brutish life. He thinks living in and not rebelling against a strong state is the best way to make this happen.

There are exceptions - a very few reasons why someone might want to disobey their sovereign. For example:



So the point is a religious leader might consider risking martyrdom by engaging in a little civil disobedience. But he goes on to say that for the average joe there is absolutely no good reason to risk bodily harm over a symbolic ceremony. I loved the language. You’ll notice there is no consistency in spelling, capitalization, or punctuation. And yet the droll style lends itself so well to subtle humor and sarcasm.

100,Brandy Cross,"This is beautifully written. Satire, humor, intelligence, wit, empathy, a boldly challenging narrative that demands you to think, even in the context of the modern century – this would have been titillating upon its release. Today it stands out as an incredibly well-written and important examination of the social contract and the place of government in society and, whether or not you agree with its conclusions, it is a powerful one.

Part 1 is a bold (and fairly good) attempt at categorizing the social aspects of the human condition for the basis of defining how humans exists in groups and in a state. Much of this is still applicable today, nearly 400 years later.

This is Incredibly brazen
- While Casually talking about how the collective social consciousness can utilize words to agree on facts about those words and thus reduce thinking to understand a subject: (e.g. define an isosceles triangle as having 2 equal sides and 2 equal angles and anyone who sees it shall know this without having to calculate), “if combinations of words contradict that agreed-upon knowledge, you can dismiss those combinations as utter nonsense. Take “ round quadrangle” or “free will”
- Aristotle was a prideful douchebag who somehow thought intelligence made him more suited to lead and that men of lesser intelligence should submit to him. What a nitwit.
- insert concise argument about why religions are made up bullshit ... oh but uhh not the uhh God everyone around me dogmatically believes in. I uhh believe in his divine power and stuff
- You can’t expect a person who’s primary concerns are what he’s going to eat tomorrow to have the ability to concern himself with “morality and right of law”
- You wouldn’t call a church or a business a person any more than you would a child. Why are we bothering with this “giving non-people rights” nonsense.

Part 2
This is an impressively complex theory of social contract. It obviously misses out and loses the context of modern developments and modern governments, but is remarkably nuanced for the time.

It defines both nuance and value in the social contract, and to valuate it and it’s merit to the people based on how they chose it. In modern terms, white Americans are tied to the social contract because they chose it and they are benefited by it. Black Americans have every right to tear down the social contract and go rebuild because they are suppressed by it.

I’m less interested in the aspects surrounding choosing government and best government because our forms of government have considerably matured over the last 300 years. This is a rational based on outdated information and written under the pressure of conforming to standards of not appearing heretical or insurgent.

- Those that are not willing to join the social contract must fight it or be consumed by it
- the state must maintain the behavior (moral conduct) of its people to preserve its value to the people.
- The protection of the state extends to the death sentence. “For seeing every subject is author of the actions of his sovereign, he punishes another for the actions committed by himself”. E.g. the state is responsible for the actions of its people. So if the state sets up a situation in which people must loot or steal to achieve their needs, the state is responsible and in killing them, the state is failing its people.
- Defining the rights of the state and the rights of the people in the state. The power of the sovereign is the power of all the people put together. The ruler can not be more powerful than the subjects and thus must submit to them as a whole. The state cannot ban dissent or riots.
- Hobbes defines any government in which one man rules as a monarchy - all other complexities fall into his 3 categories but were there more complexities in his time? This is outdated and worthless to think about today
- The passions of men are more potent than their reason.
- The wealth of a monarch utterly depends on the wealth of his people. His outcome is tied to theirs. Does this logic still hold true? In democracy and aristocracy (small groups of wealthy people ruling) the rulers can more easily profiteer off the people. Unsure of how or what this logic is based on? Other forms of government could have salary tied to wealth if lowest wage people.
- Single rulers have fewer options for corruption and fewer options to distribute power and favor to other individuals. Hobbes leans in favor of the single ruler - I disagree
- It is the responsibility of the sovereign to ensure that the next sovereign is prepared to rule. Right of rule by blood is silly? If you follow the Christian idea that representatives of god (which includes ruler) should not take wives, rulers cannot either. Right of rule by formal decision by the sovereign power is preferred. Albeit flawed and heavily corruptible.
- Social contract in families the woman is in the man’s power and the child is in the woman’s power - thus the man controls both. He doesn’t talk about this in terms of morality only absolutism. But it is a product of time. People are obliged, like children, to be subjected to those who take care of them. Slaves, who are forced into this relationship, have no such obligation. If your father is taking care of you, you are beholden to him to an extent. If someone has subjugated you, you have no such moral obligation. Again, this is outdated but interesting.
- Limiting the power of a sovereign requires subjugating oneself to a greater, limiting power. I think this is a Short-sighted theory. Checks and balances create limitations without creating a greater power. However, subjugation to that power remains So this theory is correct at least in part. You have to create multiple powers of equal power to get around this.
- No sovereign can command a person to do something that harms them, emotionally or physically. A person may decline to harm themselves or to harm others, with the understanding that this may bring harm from or to others depending on the scruples and similar feelings of other subjects.
- A man’s ability to submit to social contract is governed by his ability to understand it. If someone borrows money in good faith but does not understand the terms, he is not bound to them. If someone does not understand or know the law, he cannot hold up to it. It is the governments responsibility to ensure that the people are educated.
- Offering monopolies to merchants, like to politicians, results in losses for everyone involved
- every man is obliged to learn about laws applying to him
- No man can be held accountable for a crime necessary to preserve his life or that of his family
- Raping a married woman is a worse crime than raping an unmarried woman. Seducing a woman is a crime. Outdated and silly but a good measure of the times.
- It is a weak belief that relies on divine inspiration rather than study to inspire faith.
- Which is a kingdom divided in itself, which cannot stand. P250
- It is dangerous to allow people to win sway of popular vote by charisma. This is true. Trump. Nixon. The popular vote is valuable but dangerous in my opinion, what could be used to actually mitigate that danger? Certainly not a monarchy as Hobbes suggests.
- A government that allows a populace to remain uneducated so that they are easier to control is failing its people.
- “Shall whole nations be brought to acquiesce in the great mysteries of the Christian religion, which are above reason; and millions of men be made [to] believe that the same body be in innumerable places, at one and the same time, which is against reason; and shall not men be able, by their teaching, and preaching, protected by the law, to make that received which is so consonant to reason, that any unprejudicated man needs no more to learn it, than to hear it? I conclude therefore that in the instruction of the people in the essential rights [] and consequently it is [the sovereign’s] duty to cause them to be so instructed.
- When people are unable to work or provide for themselves, the commonwealth must do so for them.
- It is difficult to impossible for a government to call itself Christian and yet governments try and err

Christianity
This is an examination of the social contract in light of Christianity which would have been inescapable at the time. This section examines, questions, pokes fun at, and seriously gives weight to the moral and judicial responsibilities of a Christian commonwealth according to its scripture. This section also highlights the many ways in which religion and religious texts could be wrong, but of course, not the Christian Bible.

- if someone who doesn’t believe in a religion is part of that religious commonwealth, it’s his responsibility to change his faith, otherwise he absolves all men of the social contract
- Passages from the Bible are cherry picked to be law. E.g. “abstain from water and drink wine” is not law
- It is not the pope’s place to judge a king as heretical.

Henry viii died 4 years before this was published, England would have been up in arms about the legitimacy of his leaving the papacy. How much of this is a defense of that and maintaining the status quo of the monarchy?

Part four examines failings in the philosophy and religion used to support (then) modern government and thought. This is fairly complex and heavily aimed at religion.

“And if a man consider the original of this great ecclesiastical dominion, he will easily perceive that the Papacy is no other than the ghost of the deceased Roman Empire, sitting crowned upon the grave thereof. “
The Ecclesiastes take from young men the use of reason, by certain charms compounded of metaphysics and miracles and traditions and abused scriptures, whereby they are good for nothing else but to execute what they command them. The faeries likewise are said to take young children out of their cradles and to change them into natural fools.
In what shop or operators the fairies make their enchantment, the old wives have not determined. But the operations of the clergy are well known.

“To conclude, there is nothing in this whole discourse [], as far as I can perceive, contrary to either the word of god or to good manners or to the disturbance of the public tranquility. Therefore I think it may be profitability printed and more profitably taught in the universities”


Principles: without the social contract men are lawless and they have no reason not to kill and/or rob for their own benefit. Without a government; the social contract is guided solely by individual morals which, while they may be enough, in many individuals are not. This was written in the context of wars, poverty, and empires - all of which were won’t to simply take whatever they wanted. This was written as: “people have to band together and agree to a social contract or they are at risk from other people and other governments”.

The social contract exists without government, but government enforces it and gives people a way to enforce it without resorting to honor culture, where every man must defend his own rights in the social contract (leading to breaking the social contract). We can all agree that honor culture is bad.

Questions: are men lawless ?
is government as restricted as Hobbes seems to think?
Can we defend from predatory third party governments if we don’t have a commonwealth to defend?


Monarchy - these are points from a time when monarchies were just a norm. One doesn’t disregard or question bread as a food source when bread is all you eat day in day out.

Hobbes formalizes that monarchies are the most efficient leviathan government because they are predictable, stable, less prone to corruption, and heavily reliant on the wealth of the people for success. Government has notably evolved since then, and, not being tied to silly ideas of heretability or divine right of rule, we have more options. In fact, we could do much to incorporate Hobbes own fears to create beneficial structures:

* tie presidential salaries to the economy and minimum wage.
* Institute better laws banning cronyism and nepotism
* Integrate checks and balances in the government to prevent one party from taking power easily. No 2 party system, no spoils systems, no winner take all systems.

Popular vote:
Men who are not informed are ill equipped to make a rational choice of leader and will instead choose based on charisma.
* formalize political education in and after school
* Ban election advertisements
* Ban rallies
* Formalize an election process solely based on the intellectual arguments and ideas of the candidates
* Make the vote and a certain number of hours of education mandatory


In general, this is dated. But the principles of the social contract as outlined remain powerful and ultimately useful.

102,Cam Netland,"As a person who has always struggled with authority, from little league baseball to my job as a teacher, I read this book to develop an internal opposition to challenge the nagging voice that continuously whispers against my superiors.

It worked.

What a horrifying world Nature truly is and how fortunate we are to live in our modern society. A society that unconsciously values Hobbes’ social contract and consciously rejects his fallacious notions on fundamentals such as free speech or checks and balances.

At the same time, how unfortunate are we who took little heed to Hobbes’ warning about how easily our assemblies are corrupted by the interests of private men and the psychological damages from too much liberty amongst the people. I am no monarchist, but as an American I have witnessed firsthand the failures of “democracy” in a Commonwealth.

However, even our corrupted government is preferred to none at all. Hobbes’ use of inductive reasoning against what arises from the lack of a sovereign power and the natural condition of man is as frightening as it is convincing. A missing authority is far more dangerous than the presence of even a despotic one.

Not convinced? Ask yourself. Would you trust your own neighbor to help you if there were no laws nor government? What about the people two streets away?

We are afraid of anarchy and rightly so. Movies like the Purge, Birdbox, and anything zombie related question and exaggerate how we would respond in Hobbes “nature.” But they are not far off from the truth. The answer is unspoken amongst friends but known immediately to ourselves. We don’t do so great by one another when the situation is dire. And so, as much as we may hate the unjust laws, we would hate the alternative far more. Violent death and anarchy.

I may not like being told what to do but I’ve never idealized anarchy. Now I’m even further opposed to it. When no man knows what belongs to another and anarchy rules the land, there is no more right and wrong or good and evil, there is only each man securing his own peace in whatever way he can. To have such a vapid and naive view of humanity to truly believe we could coexist in such a nature is illusory. It astounds me that educated people I call friends would label themselves anarchists.

Of course, Hobbes’ solution is no panacea. Hobbes is truly outdated and limited in his reasoning, but to deny and reject everything from this work would be as foolish as it is contrarian. What I love and respect most about this work first of all is his definitions. One can trust a man who crafts original and accurate definitions for the world around them. But if one trusts completely in Hobbes, then one can hardly trust another man. And I do not trust completely in Hobbes.

Surely, we aren’t as barbaric and cruel as he claims. We care for one another and are affected negatively when bad events occur to our loved ones. We feel love amid our flawed selfish existences. I believe this, to my core. That said, Hobbes’ challenging voice returns to my own convictions and asserts we only feel such love and affection for our fellow man because of the status of government in our lives. And as for his points in Parts I and Parts II are heavily marked up with my various agreements and oppositions to his argument, I find myself agreeing with him far more than I don’t.

I annotated parts I, II, and the conclusion heavily and skimmed parts III and IV as they have more to do with Christian scholarly work and less to do with Hobbes central argument. So I committed a personal literary sin and didn’t “read” the entire work, but I believe I understand Hobbes and I completed what I believe is the relevant portion of his work to his argument and my own life.

I take a star away from Leviathan because there are outdated claims on checks and balances and free speech. I also dislike how this book may be used to justify tyranny and Hobbes’ opposition to the removal of an unjust sovereign because, as he says, the private passions of individuals are too great a multiplicity to be able to agree on what constitutes an unjust ruler. Seriously? If there is a genocidal leader, be it an assembly or one person, that leader should be removed no matter what party they represent. Finally, considering that Parts III and IV have little to do with the central argument I found them unnecessary for anyone who isn’t a biblical scholar.

103,Mladen,"Philosophical masterpiece!

I've seen a lot of highly critical reviews of Hobbes. Most people read The Leviathan through a sort of contemporary lens without fully understanding the historical context from which The Leviathan was written. It simply doesn't make any sense critiquing Hobbes without understanding the social situation of the time and the things that influenced the construction of his ideas.

Considering the time, Hobbes is one of the most understandable and relatable thinkers whose ideas are applicable even today. At the beginning of the book, you are provided with a complete glossary of terms so that all possible misinterpretations of the text are fully your own fault. The writing style is completely understandable from today's perspective which can't be said for a lot of other philosophers. Only these two things make Hobbes a man ahead of his time.

The ideas of a Leviathan controlling the nation many consider an apologetic stance towards dictatorships, totalitarian regimes etc. I consider this an irrelevant argument since Hobbes lived in the 17th century and couldn't possibly predict a contemporary concept of a dictatorship. Neither could he predict the industrial revolution and etc. Now, only considering these few aspects are you allowed to criticize Hobbes, and only from the perspective of his own time. The Leviathan was a reaction to the chaos caused by the English Civil War. Seeing what happens after revolutions, Hobbes became deeply skeptical in the spirit that brings forth revolutionary movements. He saw revolutions as manifestations of peoples pathetic, little interests and not in the interest of society in general. Mainly he attacked the clusterfuck that Cromwell had caused. Cromwell's rule resulted in a lot of dead souls, unnecessary destruction and finally the unavoidable return of a monarchy after his death. Basically, the whole affair was a sort of fiasco from Hobbes' point of view. He perceived how the aftermath of the revolution resulted in no brighter future but rather in an unstable government. From this perspective, Hobbes would be highly critical towards Stalin, Hitler or any other dictator who overthrew the legitimate government in order to impose a new order based on their own ideology. But if such an order was imposed, Hobbes' reasoning would imply that it's the peoples' own fault for letting this happen.

Concerning the ideas of man being evil, Hobbes is technically right. Consider a fully direct democracy where everyone can intervene and voice their opinion on anything. It would be completely chaotic and nothing would ever be done because you would always find a certain group of people who would, for this or that reason, disagree with the implementation of a certain policy. This is, basically the reason why we have representative democracies and direct democracies only on small scales. The concept simply doesn't seem applicable on a national level.

I grant that Hobbes is a little too lenient towards the amount of power granted to the Leviathan, but this again is the result of the time the book was written. I found his materialistic and analytical approach far more enjoyable than most other philosophers of the time.

104,Dee,"Appalling! Interesting!

Hobbes really pissed me off. Some people won't read an author who says things they strongly disagree with and that's a big mistake. Not that I disagree with everything in Leviathan or that I'm ticked off by everything Hobbes says. But if ideas are upsetting, that's all the more reason you ought to learn more. They may be very important ideas-hence their power to upset.

At first this was looking to be a very hard read. Once I acquainted myself with the structure-it's hundreds of little essays, grouped to make a sort of huge meta essay-it became possible to jump back and forth to follow my nose, reading them out of order. There are so many ideas; each section is a nifty little package of ideas! If you give it a chance, and you enjoy learning the ideas of different times, this book will grow on you.

If you are fairly well read, you'll recognize much of what you read in the thought of today. I was appalled by the power Hobbes said the state must have over it's citizens, and their obligations to their rulers. Also, the rulers have certain limits and obligations, but not nearly enough, so far's I'm concerned. Frankly, Hobbes pisses me off. That alone made it a worthwhile read. Anything to do with social contract is liable to annoy me, and this is probably the oldest writing specifically addressing social contract, tho' he doesn't use that term. Anyhow, if you've got a political conscience to go along with your political consciousness (Wikipedia the terms if that doesn't make sense to you), then you ought to read at least some of Leviathan. I'll admit, I haven't read it all but I'm putting it under read. It's just not the sort of book you must read cover to cover. It's a collection of essays.

It's so weird, to read something reflecting political conscience of such a different time. The politics and theology were certainly close bedfellows.

I found a nifty 'intertextual reference,' to borrow some jargon from academia. ""A Confederacy of Deceivers ..."" is mentioned in the essay on the Kingdom of Darkness. John Kennedy Toole's book, ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" clearly got it's name from Hobbes.

105,Luke,"Since GoodReads does not allow me to rate books with half-stars, I rate this book as a 3/5 on here when in reality I would place it at a 3.5/5. Why is this important? I rate it as such as compromise towards my feelings on this Behemoth of a text (or should I say Leviathan) in part as compared to it as a whole.

Before reading this text I came to be informed that many publications of this massive text historically have abridged it by only maintaining the first two parts of the work. This turned me off as I believe every text is meant to be read in whole and not in part, but after having read the entirety of Leviathan I can't say I don't blame those who stop reading after part two. As an entire work, Leviathan tries to cover too much in my opinion. As a work for which it is subtitled: ""The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil"" it serves its purpose although I would argue only in the latter. Leviathan as read as a work of political philosophy and perhaps of human nature (of the civil) it is a masterpiece of English philosophy. However, Leviathan is not just that. Leviathan is a work of metaphysics, epistemology, linguistics, discussion of the sciences, an argument against most Christian doctrines, an argument against Catholicism, an argument against scholasticism, and much more.

While I would find value in his metaphysical and epistemological writings in the first part as prelude to his discussion of the state of nature, it is not the most sophisticated exploration of materialism or empiricism even at its time, and his work on language seems rather shakey.

I am not one to judge the theological work and debate in this book as I am no expert of Christianity myself, and the debates seem to be very much of its era without too much value outside of historical study.

Leviatan, o la Materia, Forma y Poder de una República Eclesiástica y Civil
Fondo de Cultura Económica, México
1994 (Primera edición en inglés es de 1651)

Leyendo el prefacio, queda claro que es importante leer sobre el contexto de Inglaterra en ése entonces. Hobbes nació en 1588 y murió en 1679, coincidiendo parte de su vida con la de Descartes y Newton. “Es lenguaje universal, sin medida de tiempo ni de espacio”, como indica Manuel Sánchez Sarto. No se conocen los nombres del papá y de la mamá. El nació cuando la Armada Española llegaba a Inglaterra. Luego fue teniendo muy buena educación y llegó a la universidad de Oxford. No confió en los Escolásticos.

Me llama la atención que el libro (600p) tiene tres grandes partes: el hombre, el estado y las tinieblas. Me sorprendió encontrar que en la primera parte entra a definir el significado de las palabras, para llegar a formar frases, juicios, conocimiento, etc., etc. Es muy poderoso el método y por ello se le considera como fundador de la filosofía política moderna.

Me gustó mucho el capítulo XII, sobre la religión. Solo el ser humano la tiene. “…nada sugiere la razón, y deja que cada uno persista en ella o, para otras ceremonias, confíe en quienes considere más sabios”. 90 Dos tipos de seres humanos: (a) quienes ordenan la religioso de acuerdo con su propia invención (feligreses más aptos para la obediencia), (b) bajo el mando y dirección de Dios (política divina).

Fue interesante el entrar en las Leyes Naturales y los Contratos, y la transferencia de derechos. Por un lado se acerca uno a los acuerdos de la palabra y de la ley (un tris enredado), y por otro (interesantes!) a lo que son las “conversaciones para la acción”, que están a la base de Facebook, Twitter, y las diferentes redes sociales. El concepto de buscar la paz aparece como central (v. Cap IXV, p.107).

La segunda parte está dedicada al Estado. Los pactos descansan en la espada, pues no tenemos el principio de organización (o la falta de honores y dignidad) que sí tienen las abejas o las hormigas. Estamos entonces ante la necesidad de conformar el gran Leviatán (“el dios mortal , al cual debemos, bajo el Dios inmortal, nuestra paz y nuestra defensa”. 141 Ocurre por adquisición (fuerza natural) o por institución (los hombres se ponen de acuerdo entre sí). Es un rico capítulo porque entra en varios de los “detalles” grandes de la Revolución Inglesa (English Civil War). En la página 149 entra en los detalles de aquel momento.

Hemos creado un hombre artificial llamado Estado y cadenas artificiales llamadas leyes civiles. “Tanto si el Estado es monárquico, como si es popular, la libertad es siempre la misma”. 175 Es muy interesante el tratamiento que hace del mercado y del comercio, que alimenta bien los procesos de los TLCs actuales. P.191 Atención a los cuerpos privados regulares, pero ilegales. Igual vale para quienes se proponen el gobierno de la religión.

En el simil que hace entre hombre y Estado me gustó:
• “… es cuanto tengo que decir respecto a los sistemas y asambleas del pueblo, que pueden ser comparadas, como digo, a las partes semejantes del cuerpo humano; las legítimas a los músculos; las ilegales a los tumores, cálculos y apostemas, engendrados por la antinatural confluencia de humores malignos”.
• “Es la razón del Estado, nuestro hombre artificial y sus mandamientos, lo que constituye la ley”.222
• “Por consiguiente, las leyes de la naturaleza no necesitan ni publicación ni promulgación, ya que están contenidas en esta sentencia, aprobada por todo el mundo: No hagas a otro lo que tú consideres irrazonable que otro te haga a ti”. 223
• “La ley de naturaleza se convierte en la más oscura de todas las leyes, y es, por consiguiente, la más necesitada de intérpretes capaces”. 226
• Leviatán (cap 41 de Job), “Dios, habiendo establecido el gran poder del Leviatán, le denomina rey de la arrogancia. Nada existe sobre la tierra que pueda compararse con él. Está hecho para no sentir el miedo.”262
• “No existe acción humana en esta vida que no sea el comienzo de una cadena de consecuencias, tan larga, que ninguna providencia humana es lo bastante elevada para dar al hombre una perspectiva del fin”. 303

Traté de leer con juicio la Tercera Parte, más referida al Estado Cristiano. Es un poco como regresar al primer capítulo (definición de términos), pero en relación con Dios, los libros sagrados y los personajes y rito de todo tipo que aparecen: profetas, discípulos, Cristo, la resurrección, la ascensión, los apóstoles, rol de Pedro, y sacerdotes, y un largo etc. que nos lleva al cielo, al infierno y al purgatorio; también a Roma y al Sumo Pontífice. En las distintas partes hay referencias a personajes de la época respectiva, pero no le vi sentido en seguirlo. Me gustó mucho estas 4 palabras que tienen mucha fuerza: “Mi presencia irá contigo”. 332 Otra importante: “Todo hombre debe examinar la probabilidad de una supuesta vocación de profeta”. 358 Interesante como se plantea la relación entre el Sumo Pontífice y la autoridad civil.

La Parte Cuatro me pareció sensacional pues muestra cómo el catolicismo arma todo su andamiaje para mostrar su representación de Dios. Me gustó mucho el tratamiento que hace del Papa, las órdenes de sacerdotes y el matrimonio. Muy impresionante como indica que la jerarquía plena del Papa es el reino de las tinieblas y reino de las brujas.574 El final de esta parte es sensacional: “No fue, por consiguiente, cosa difícil, para Enrique VIII a pesar del exorcismo, ni para la reina Isabel a pesar del suyo, expulsarlos”

Me toca mirar:
• Qué entiende Hobbes por hombres de ánimo femenino?
• Quiero entender “El hombre es el sexo más excelente”
• Quiénes fueron “las Amazonas” (163) quienes contrataban hombres de los países vecinos?
• En p. 167 entra en los derechos de la Monarquía gracias a las Escrituras.

The best way to summarise Hobbes' ideas are to analyze the gorgeously appointed frontispiece:



The overarching, gargantuan figure, emboldened with his crown, sword in his right hand, & symbol of ecclesiastic authority in his left, is the temporal monarch. The source of absolute authority, the final word on all matters of the spirit, of war, of money, & social order. His body is made up of the people he rules, showing both his authority over the population, & his authority flowing from the body of the population that comply with the social contract.

The latin phrase above him, ""Non est super terram potestas quæ comparetur ei"", translates to ""there is no power on earth that is compared to him"", cementing the fact that it is the temporal monarch where all bucks stop.

The temporal monarch looms over the country side, showing his command over organizing natures resources, & the walled city, where member of the social contract reside. The walls symbolize the protection given to the citizens by the monarch, by his grace.

The scenes on either side of the title communicate the granular details of Hobbes' arguments.

In order from top left to bottom right:

1) The castle shows authority, central command, & stalwart protection from invasion or civil war.

2) The church shows another branch of the temporal monarchs authority, control of ecclesiastical matters.

3) The crown is the symbol of authority, easily interpreted by citizens & foreigners alike.

4) The bishops hat shows his source of divine provenance, that he is both the head of the church & the source of divine law.

5) The cannon is an instrument of both control & defense, a weapon turned upon foe & citizen alike, if the citizenry ""misbehave""

6) The lightning emanating from the cloud show divine justice. That the monarchs divine law carries divine repercussions.

7) An arsenal shows the mighty power of the monarch's military. It also shows abundance of military resources, lest a foe be tempted to test the resilience of the monarch's military.

8) The assembly of farming tools communicates the monarchs ability to provide for the citizenry, that an abundance of resources are able for harvest. Note that it falls below divine power, which shows us that the citizens are blessed by God when receiving nature's bounty.

9) War. An essential component of the temporal monarchs instruments of power, waged in defence & conquest. Defence of the citizens is a primary concern, & conquest is the obligation of the monarch to extend his absolute authority over all corners of the world.

10) The court. This is a fundamental source of the monarchs authority, issuing rulings & creating precedent to effectively legislate the citizenry.

109,Varad,"Just about every aspect of Hobbes' immeasurably influential treatise has been subject to centuries' worth of scrutiny and analysis: from his characterization of human life in the state of nature as ""nasty, brutish, [and] short""; to his conception of sovereignty and his demand that it be unequivocal and indivisible, with no rival source of power or legitimacy allowed within the commonwealth, whether that be in the form of individual dissent or alternative sources of power such as the church; to his conception of a possible civic religion; and numerous other subjects. The thrust of his argument leads, from which ever direction he attacks, always to one target: the absolute power of the state, secure and unmatched. Hobbes' justification of his absolutism on the grounds that it alone can maintain the peace and sanctity of the state, which would otherwise be riven by the squabbles, disputes, and strife - political and religious - which were tearing asunder Europe in the middle of the seventeenth century has been controversial from the moment it issued from the press. There's nothing I can add to that debate.

I only want to emphasize two aspects of the book which tend to get lost in the shuffle. The first is that Hobbes discusses many topics that textbook summaries of give the reader no inkling to expect. The book starts not with politics but with a long summation of epistemology and metaphysics, matters which Hobbes reverts to from time to time all the way to the end. He spends considerable time attacking the views of his opponents and their reasons for holding them; the Catholic Church and scholasticism are subject to several fulsome barrages. The last two hundred pages of the book are, more or less, devoted to biblical criticism and exegesis. The end always is to vindicate Hobbes' conception of sovereignty (by, in this case, eroding the grounds by which the Catholic Church and the pope have propagated and defended their temporal power); but he is as careful and scrupulous in doing so as any exegete or glossator, which can be quite tedious for the reader, buried under citation after citation of chapter and verse.

The second unexpected feature of the book is its language. Hobbes is nothing less than a master of English prose, one of its finest and most eloquent stylists. Perhaps the most powerful and compelling of his rhetorical gifts is his command of metaphor: it is nothing less than Homeric. Take for example his description of scholars who are too intent on maintaining their categories than seeking genuine knowledge, and so go astray: ""From whence it happens, that they which trust to books, do as they that cast up many little summs into a greater, without considering whether those little summes were rightly cast up or not; and at last finding the errour visible, and not mistrusting their first grounds, know not which way to cleere themselves; but spend time in fluttering over their bookes; as birds that entring by the chimney, and finding themselves inclosed in a chamber, flitter at the false light of a glasse window, for want of wit to consider which way they came in"" (28). Or consider this one from near the end of the book, also about the errors and follies of Hobbes' intellectual foes: ""But to what purpose (may some man say) is such subtilty in a work of this nature, where I pretend to nothing but what is necessary to the doctrine of Government and Obedience? It is to this purpose, that men may no longer suffer themselves to be abused, by them, that by this doctrine of Separated Essences, built on the Vain Philosophy of Aristotle, would fright them from Obeying the Laws of their Countrey, with empty names; as men fright Birds from the Corn with an empty doublet, a hat, and a crooked stick"" (465). Which is perhaps to say, that bad thinking is a straw-man! Nor his Hobbes without a sense of humor, as when he notes, while ridiculing the existence of ghosts, that whenever they are sighted, it never fails that ""their clothes which they appear in"" manifest, too (466).

The great irony is that Hobbes wielded metaphor with profound fluency and persuasion while decrying its capacity to gull the weak-minded. To ""use words metaphorically; that is, in other sense than that they are ordained for; and thereby deceive others"" is one of the ""abuses of speech"" Hobbes enumerates in his early chapter ""On Speech"" (26). It is a charge he reiterates throughout. ""[T]he use of Metaphors, Tropes, and other Rhetoricall figures, in stead of words proper"" is one of the causes of absurd reasoning. ""For though it be lawfull to say, (for example) in common speech, The Way Goeth, Or Leadeth Hither, Or Thither, The Proverb Sayes This Or That (whereas wayes cannot go, nor Proverbs speak;) yet in reckoning, and seeking of truth, such speeches are not to be admitted"" (35). Indeed, as far as he is concerned, ""Metaphors, and senslesse and ambiguous words, are like ; and reasoning upon them, is wandering amongst innumerable absurdities; and their end, contention, and sedition, or contempt"" (36). Never should a counselor use metaphor when proffering advise, because of metaphor's innate tendency to mislead and stir up passions (180).

Yet Hobbes says this too, when describing the characteristics of natural intellect and wit: ""Besides the Discretion of times, places, and persons, necessary to a good Fancy, there is required also an often application of his thoughts to their End; that is to say, to some use to be made of them. This done; he that hath this Vertue, will be easily fitted with similitudes, that will please, not onely by illustration of his discourse, and adorning it with new and apt metaphors; but also, by the rarity or their invention"" (51). On this score at least it may be said that Hobbes was guilty of no false modesty.

is complex, demanding, difficult, and long. It requires much of the reader. But it repays much in return. It bears and deserves the most attention the reader can give it. It is a canonical text if ever there was one. But what becomes clear on page after page of dense, often archaic prose, is that Hobbes and his book have earned their place in it.

This took a while to get through. Every time I tried reading this, it took so long to understand each concept and remember all of his definitions. I really recommend for those who are reading this for a class to create a system, like note-taking, for it. What I found most challenging was understanding the big picture. His writing is supposed to be very organized and methodological, but I can't help but feel it jumps around a lot. For instance, he begins the book by examining the human as an individual being i.e. a mechanical being. He lays out his various definitions such as sense and imagination, which is useful but is barely referenced when he talks about the commonwealth. There isn't much of a smooth transition between these sections, especially when he starts talking about the Christian commonwealth. I still don't have a clear sense of why he includes this section. Maybe it was just because it was relevant at that time. British politics was dominated by Christianity. But it could also be a much more fundamental argument. Maybe he believes that religion is embedded in the nature of politics. It could also be that he was just trying to convince Christians to agree with his ideas. A lot of it remains a mystery.

- legend, after God made man, who asked God: ""God, ah, we are weak and then you create a hero and let him to protect us."" God said: ""hero while protecting your will Oppress you and eat you."" Later, in order to resist all kinds of external risks, people created a Leviathan and created a behemoth that can make them feel of belonging-the government.

""Leviathan"", first published in England in 1651. Social books. It is divided into four parts. The first part ""On man"", based on the inherent ability of man, discusses the ""state of nature"" and natural law. The second part, ""On the State"", mainly discusses the various forms, sovereignty and human rights of the country produced by the contract. The third part, ""On the Christian State"", mainly discusses the political status of the church and personal freedom of belief. The fourth part, ""On the Kingdom of Darkness"", mainly launches an ideological criticism of religion, philosophy and political thought. It clarifies the social contract theory in detail.

Hobbs was born in Wilt, England in 1588 and died in 1679. Studied at Oxford University. He created a complete system of mechanical materialism, pointing out that the universe is the sum of all mechanically moving extensive objects. He proposed ""state of nature"" and the origin of the state said, noting that the country is in order to comply with the ""natural law"" and to contract the shape into, is a man-made robot, against the divine right of kings, advocated absolute monarchy. He compared the Pope to a demon and the monks to a group of ghosts, but advocated using the ""state religion"" to control the people and maintain ""order."" Representative works: ""Hobbes"", ""Behemoth"", etc.

Leviathan, which means crack, is a sea monster that symbolizes evil in the Bible and is usually described as a whale. Leviathan is often associated with another kind of monster Behemoth. The record of Leviathan closely follows the next chapter of Behemoth in the Book of Job. The actual Leviathan described in the book There is a fish above, with hard scales, sharp teeth, and spikes under its abdomen, which is daunting. In Christianity, Leviathan became synonymous with the devil and was crowned with ""jealousy"", one of the seven deadly sins.

The state machine is a macroscopic man, and man is also a microscopic state machine. For a country, sovereignty is its soul, officials are its joints, rewards and punishments are its nerves, wealth is its tangible benefits, security is its cause, consultants are its files, fairness and law are its reason and peace It is its health, turmoil is its disease, and civil war is its death.

For individuals, the soul is our head of state, the joint is our executive agency, the nerve is our incentive and punishment mechanism, income is our GDP, security is our national defense, thinking is our national think tank, and reason is us Health is our long-term stability, disease is our political turmoil, and death is the destruction of our country.

As far as understanding is concerned, there may not be much difference between people. People's ability to understand the link of reasoning is different, which may be caused by different understanding of definitions and preliminary knowledge. All effective reasoning should be based on clear definitions as the primary premise. Our learning process is often like this, starting with nouns, then connecting the nouns to form an assertion, and then connecting the assertion to form an argument. It is undoubtedly foolish for a person to give up judgment and reasoning and use authoritative words and sentences as guidelines.

Madness is just an overexpression of passion. It is difficult for you to see it in a peaceful walker, because his heart is calm; and the function of wine is to cancel all pretense, and the heart is full of unregulated passion, and After the disguise was removed, all he showed was madness.

In a monarchy country, the subjects call the monarch his majesty and respect him as the sovereign, but he himself, including his subjects, do not consider him to be the representative of the subjects, and the title of representative belongs to those who submit the petition for consultation . The Romans sent officials as governors to govern the ruled places. For the Roman people, this was a parliament or democracy, but for the ruled who had no right to join the government, it was a monarchy.

"" The giant ""Leviathan "" known as ""the whole of the nation"" or ""country"" was created by art. It is just a ""man-made person""; although it is much stronger than a natural person, it is based on protecting natural persons. Purpose; in the ""Leviathan"", ""sovereignty"" is the ""man-made soul"" that enables the whole to get life and activities; officials and other judicial and administrative personnel are man-made ""joints""; used to closely connect the highest sovereign positions and promote The ""reward"" and ""punishment"" for each joint and member to perform their tasks are ""nervous"", which is the same as that of natural persons; the ""assets"" and ""wealth"" of all individual members are ""strength""; the safety of the people is it It’s ""career""; the consultants who provide it with the necessary knowledge are its ""memory""; ""fairness"" and ""law"" are man-made ""reason"" and ""will""; ""harmony"" is its ""health""; ""turmoil"" ""Is its ""disease"", and ""civil war"" is its ""death."" Finally, the ""covenant"" and ""covenant"" used to establish, unite and organize the various parts of this political group are God creating The ""command"" announced in the world, that command is ""we want to make people. ""

In social animals , except humans, there will be other social animals from the group in the organizational structure of produce, such as orangutans and ants have their own social organization. But human social organization , is that we know so far the most complex organisms but also the most powerful form of organization. This virtual structure is a necessary condition for us to connect billions of people. Therefore , we need to study how the state is organized and operated. In order to make it work better, so as to bring the happiest life possible to as many individuals living in it as possible. This is the meaning of the existence of a country.

"" Know yourself. This sentence does not mean to support the barbaric attitude of the powerful towards people of low status, as it is applied now, nor does it mean to encourage the lower class to treat people who are higher than themselves. It is not inferior to the behavior, but teaches us that since a person’s thoughts and feelings are similar to those of others, each person should consider when he is “thinking”, “conceiving”, “reasoning”, “hope” and “ Afraid ""While waiting, what is he doing and what he does so based on; so he can understand and know the thoughts and feelings of others in similar situations. ""

Eastern and Western philosophy at home in , there are some philosophers who emphasized that should be explored inward. Socrates said to know yourself. Confucius said, do not do to others what you do not want. In fact, the logic behind it is based on the assumption that human nature is similar . The most thorough object we can study is ourselves. When we can study clearly their own time, we will be able to migrate to the results of their research is applied to someone else to go, others will also be able to emotion and reaction, do the explaining and predicting.

"" This kind of fading feeling, when it refers to the thing itself (I mean the illusion itself), then we call it imagination as I said before. But if it refers to the declining Process, which means speaking, the fading of sensations, aging or becoming the past, we call it memory. Therefore, imagination and memory are the same thing, but have different names due to different considerations. ""

"" Imaginations in sleep are called dreams. Like other imaginations, they have existed in the senses in whole or in part in the past. In terms of sense, the necessary receptors such as the brain and nerves are all in the eyes of sleep. It is numb and not easily driven by the action of external objects. Therefore, during sleep, except for the phenomena caused by the turmoil of various parts of the human body, imagination is small, so there is no dream. These internal parts are due to the brain and other The organs are connected, so when they are turbulent and restless, they will cause the related parts to move, so the imagination formed in these organs in the past will appear as if they are awake; only because the sensory organs are in a state of numbness, there is no new object Dominate and cover them with stronger impressions; therefore, in the static state of this feeling, dreams will inevitably be clearer than our waking thinking. Therefore, feelings and dreams are not easy to be strictly different. Many people I even thought it was impossible to make this distinction. ""

"" The thinking series or psychological discussions mentioned above can be divided into two types, one is non-directed, purposeless and inconstant. In this kind of thinking sequence, no passionate thinking regards itself as a certain desire or passion. The goal or scope of the person is to control or guide the subsequent thoughts towards oneself. This situation is called thought disorientation, and it seems that they are not related to each other like in a dream. People who stay alone and don’t pay attention to anything think like This is the thinking. ""

This kind of thought when there is no clear goal is probably like the thought fragments in your mind when you go to bed and walk alone after dinner. It doesn't have a clear theme, I don't know where I am going, or where I will swim next.

"" The second kind of thinking series is more constant than the former because it is controlled by a certain desire and purpose. Because the impressions produced by things we want or fear are strong and lasting, and if temporarily interrupted, they will quickly recover. Its The intensity can sometimes hinder sleep or wake us up. With desire, we will think of a certain method that we have seen in the past to produce similar existing goals. Starting from this kind of thinking, we will also think of ways to obtain this method. ; This continues until a certain starting point within our ability. ""

This kind of thinking is more like class discussion or deep thinking about a certain problem. Because thinking naturally has a tendency to diverge, we need to use willpower from time to time to pull our thoughts back to the original path. Just like when discussing at a meeting, there must be a meeting host to grasp the progress of the discussion and prevent people from gradually turning off the topic during the discussion .

"" One person has more experience of the past than another, and he is more cautious than the other, and his predictions are less miscalculated. There is only reality in nature, and the past can only exist in memory , and the future things are just mind simply does not exist in the future will apply to the existing sequence past behavior caused by the behavior of the sequence hypothesis;.. assume the most experienced people made most certainly, but also not entirely sure . ""

"" First, humans are constantly striving for honor and status, but these animals are not. Therefore, humans will have jealousy and hatred for this reason, and finally war will occur, but these animals are not in this situation. Secondly. : Among these animals, there is no divergence between common interests and individual interests; according to their nature, they plan for their own individual interests, which also contributes to the public interest. However, the happiness of human beings lies in comparing themselves with others, and feeling proud is just Things that stand out.

Third, these animals do not use their intellect like humans, they cannot see, and they do not think they can see any shortcomings in the management of public affairs. But among human beings, there are many people who think they are smarter and more capable than others and can better manage the public; so some people want to reform in one direction, while others try to reform in the other direction, thus causing the group to fall into chaos And during the civil war. Fourth, although these animals can also use some sounds to express their desires and other feelings to each other, they do not have the language skills of some humans. They can speak of good as evil to others and evil as good. It also exaggerates or reduces the obvious degree of good and evil, arbitrarily confuses people, and disrupts peace.

Fifth, animals without reason cannot distinguish between intangible aggression and tangible loss; so when they are at ease, they will not feel offended by their peers; while humans are at their most troublesome time when they are at their best; because in this At that time, they like to show their intelligence and love to control the behavior of state authorities. Finally: the coordination of these animals is natural, while the agreement of humans is only based on the covenant, which is artificial. Therefore, it is not surprising if something other than the letter of agreement is needed to make their agreement strong and lasting. This kind of thing is the common power that makes everyone afraid and guides their actions for the common good. . ""

In the "" Old Testament "" in , a very important event is the Moses received God's instructions precepts , and passes it to the Jews, asking everyone to abide by. This group is commonly accepted contract is the first country to start a step. In social animals other than humans, there is no such contract. What ants and bees follow are their natural instincts. This instinct is like the reproduction of diet , which is brought by genes , rather than being taught through active thinking.

145,John,"I’ll preface this review by saying that I’ve only read Books I-II of Leviathan (about half), but as a close friend recently told me, “That may be a new record.” Although the title refers to the ideal leader of state, it could easily be attributed to the book itself; it’s a truly exhaustive, and exhausting, development of Hobbes’ theory of political government, and it took me more than 2 months to sort through the first 400-odd pages.

Besides its girth, the first thing that I would say usually dissuades readers from Hobbes’ masterwork is the fact that many of its theories on government have been discarded over the last 300 years. He was not a fan of representative democracy – he held a largely pessimistic view on collective human nature – and viewed absolute rule under one centralized authority as the only form of government capable of controlling large groups of people with conflicting goals and opinions.

That said, what kept me reading the first two books was how rigorously and completely he develops his theories of government from very basic anatomic principles and universal truths. It goes something like this:

In Book I, entitled “Of Man,” Hobbes uses the scientific principles of his time to show how the human body operates in the world, gaining knowledge and competing with other human bodies for supremacy; this is, in the parlance of Locke, Rousseau, Hume and other 16th and 17th Century philosophers, the State of Nature, which in Hobbes words makes every human life “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”

(I suspect that Hobbes, while using biblical references and terminology, was a closet atheist, as his view of human nature and survival was Darwinist well before Darwin. I’ve found at least one religious zealot in my book inventory who agrees with me, a missionary named Paul Hutchinson who wrote a book called “The New Leviathan” directly after WWII comparing the communist governments of Russia and China the ideal all-powerful state power Hobbes set forth in Leviathan. Of course, Hutchinson doesn’t mind playing both sides of the coin, also referring to the fascist regimes of Mussolini and Hitler in Hobbesian terms in one chapter entitled “The Worship of the ‘Mortal God’.”)

It’s interesting and ironic that Hobbes in Book I derides educators and philosophers such as Aristotle, Cicero, and St. Thomas of Aquinas for your use of metaphors, which are to his empirical understanding not absolute and thus not reliable (“For words are wise mens counters, they do but reckon by them: but they are the mony of fooles” – Chapter 4), since Book II of Leviathan, “Of Commonwealth,” relies entirely upon the metaphor of government functioning as a human body. To his mind, every functional nation of the world is in the state of nature (in other words, the state of war) with every other nation. This, to his mind, is why nations are formed – [CUT] to protect the citizens, i.e., the parts of the body, from harm by other nations, i.e., political bodies.

The only way Hobbes saw to do this – and this is where Hobbes has aged worst – was through enforced dictatorial rule, as the only way to keep people from breaking civil and natural laws was through fear of retribution (to be fair, Hobbes wrote Leviathan while in exile during one of England’s bloodiest civil wars, so his primary political motive was ending internal conflict). I think the reason this opinion is universally decried is that most ideologies from either end of the political spectrum have something not to like – free-market advocates see the competition Hobbes wanted to eliminate as the ideal ruling power; his centralized oligarchical rule is exactly what liberal constitutionalists created social contracts against; religious fundamentalists are continually up in arms when the government conflicts with their own tenets.

Jane Jacobs in the introduction to The Death and Life of Great American Cities rails against urban planners of the time she wrote it (it was first published in 1961) as “earnest and learned men, dealing with complex phenomena they do not understand at all and trying to make do with a pseudoscience.” I probably wouldn’t use such strong language about Hobbes’ political philosophy, but the principle is similar – Hobbes may have gotten it all wrong, but he got it wrong better than most of us have gotten it right.",False,,,58,10,3.0,1.0,,en,"I’ll preface review saying I’ve read Books I-II Leviathan (about half), close friend recently told me, “That may new record.” Although title refers ideal leader state, could easily attributed book itself; it’s truly exhaustive, exhausting, development Hobbes’ theory political government, took 2 months sort first 400-odd pages.

Part of this book was the author listing things they knew or had thought about and became monotonous, but there were other parts where they expounded on the rules of society in really practical situations. They also seemed to acknowledge a lot of progressive ideas about gender roles but fell short of condoning them. There were also long passages on Christianity and it was hard for me to reconcile them with all of their logical pondering in the first part of the book.

150,Sam Reeve,"One of the most significant treatises of the Enlightenment, and therefore, of modernity and of Western society today.

I see a lot of negative reviews of the text, mainly people are articulating their opinions as 'disagreeing' with his social contract, with his view of natural man and absolute monarchy. This, may be the case from a 21st Century perspective. But you need to, you HAVE to consider this work in greater context and detail before you submit your final verdict.

If you consider the context in which Hobbes wrote, it immediately justifies the excruciating detail and length he delves to in order to supplant his message in the reader's mind. He was a pacifist. He had just beared witness to one of the most bloody periods in human existence. This shaped the opinion of man to strive for peace and prosperity. He, most definitely against his better desire, saw brutality in man - it was all he was ever exposed to...

More than anything, Hobbes was inveighing against the prevailing Christian values that dominated at the time. Hobbes took to great measure as to cover his back from the Church and the State. In this period - if there is even the slightest hint of subversion to Christianity, I think we all know what comes next for the author.

An Exoteric, who outwardly veils a secret teaching of some sort, identifies in this message a plea to the end of violence. A hope, however unfounded this is. Hobbes exposed his radical beliefs to the world with the intention of making change, and that is EXACTLY what he did. He inspired a lot of change, and frankly shaped the enlightenment period on par with thinkers like Machiavelli, Rousseau and Locke.

We need to think of Hobbes as providing as with a model of authority, dominance and legitimacy to further refine our beliefs of political theory as a whole. Hobbes walked so we could run. Without Leviathan, we could not have had all that came after it. He gave us the roots of modern society and government to enable us to live with the peacefulness he had envisioned.

It's upsetting to see a contemporary audience strip away the contextualism of a great work, to instead superimpose their own beliefs against a completely different period and set of ideas.

151,Arjun Ravichandran,"Thomas Hobbes’ ‘Leviathan’ was written during the turmoil of the English Civil war – a conflict caused precisely by the sort of divided sovereignty he rails against in this seminal text. The book is therefore filled with glimpses of a seething sarcasm, quite unbecoming for an austere English political philosopher.

Nonetheless, Hobbes aim in his tract is clear – he intends to offer a ‘science of politics’. His definition of science is very particular, and informed by his parallel careers as a geometer and mathematician. He therefore shares with Euclid, and Spinoza, the ambition towards a philosophical construction built on irrefutable axioms.

Part of Hobbes’ reputation for greatness rests on the difficulty of his enterprise ; Euclid had no dramas in defining a line as stretching between two points. Hobbes, dealing with the messy raw material of human psychology, has the task of attempting a similar axiomatic approach. Therefore, Leviathan begins with a long discussion on human nature, predicated on resolutely materialistic grounds.

External stimuli stimulates (as stimuli are wont to do) our sense organs, giving rise to motion within. This motion, called sense, in turn gives rise to imagination – again, a term defined carefully by Hobbes, as meaning a picture of causal relationship. Imagination requires a mark to hold its place, and thus language comes into play. Language is also important in verifying our imagination (and thus the causal picture of the external world) with our peers. The social sedimentation of the floating signifiers of language, then gives rise to reason – the abstract weighing of causality, typified in the syllogism.

(One of the book’s rather entertaining detours, is Hobbes’ condescending treatment of ‘insignificant speech’, which arises, in his view, from the uprooting of words from their proper place, and using them in inappropriate contexts ; ‘an incorporeal body’, for example. Parallels with Wittgenstein are abundant. In an underrated line from the text, Hobbes asserts that ‘the privilege of reason is also the privilege of absurdity.’)

This mechanistic picture of the human being allows Hobbes to postulate a few ‘natural laws’- most pointedly, that man everywhere aims to avoid death, and actualize his well-being, however so he defines it, and with whatever implements he has at hand. With this move, the path towards a science of politics begins.

The discussion of motion, sense, imagination, incipient reason, the desire for self-preservation and avoidance of harm, the concomitant desire for unsubtle self-actualization, the postulation of natural laws that encompass all of these, allows Hobbes to posit the fundamental axiom of his science – the ‘state of nature’. Given that men are fundamentally equal in their desire to flourish, and in their parallel distrust of each other’s capacity of the same, a state of war of all against all pertains.

While Hobbes makes scattered remarks regarding the actuality of this state of nature, either in the past, or in his own time, I find it best to think of it as an abstract entity, much in the same manner that no perfect circle exists. It is only given this axiom, that the structure of his argument, as well as the results he obtains, hold water. It is in this discussion of the state of nature, that his famous line, of man’s life in this environment being ‘nasty, brutish and short’ finds place.

However, all is not doom and gloom – because men have reason that stems from their instinct for self-preservation/self-actualization, they intuit that a war of all against all results in the destruction of all. They thus decide to abrogate some of their natural liberty and jointly invest it in a sovereign, culminating in a commonwealth.

The rest of Hobbes’ analysis deals with the nature of this sovereign – the eponymous Leviathan. With geometric absolutism, Hobbes insists that the power of the sovereign be absolute. Any attempt to partition this power can only mean undermining that same power – everywhere Hobbes hangs the spectre of a return to the state of nature as haunting the commonwealth, lest the principle of absolute sovereignty be adhered to. It is the sovereign alone who is absolutely free – to act by his lights as to the best interests of the commonwealth – and all his subjects, having agreed to this arrangement (or having ‘covenanted’ to do so, as Hobbes puts it) are ordained to be powerless in this regard.

It is a compelling argument, amongst the finer examples of social-contract theory, as well as primitively prefiguring game-theory. Some queries do remain however – firstly is his insistence that men agree freely to transfer some portion of their natural liberty to a common sovereign. The key word here being ‘freely’ – Hobbes insists that this freedom pertains, even if we picture a gathering of tribesmen anointing a king, or alternatively, a freeman being threatened at knife-point to swear allegiance. The argument here, as I take it, is that fear is common to both arrangements ; on the one hand, the fear of one’s fellows in a hypothetical state of nature, and in the other, the fear of immediate bodily harm from an alien sovereign. That one should be called free, and the other not so, is an absurdity in Hobbes’ reckoning.

Another doubt pertains to his treatment of children. In delineating the authority of the sovereign as stemming from the free abrogation of liberty, Hobbes notes that for the child, his natural sovereign is the father. Analogously, the child, in his fear of the danger attendant upon his vulnerable state, abrogates his liberty to his father. The solidity of this argument is open to doubt. I could only think of Thomas Jefferson’s idle quote, that every generation should have the right to institute their own form of government.

Additionally, even accepting Hobbes’ contention that a commonwealth underlined by absolute sovereignty is the best possible state for civilized man, the question remains as to whether this is ultimately desirable. What would Hobbes have had to say to Proudhon’s exhortation that ‘destruction too is a creative endeavour’? Or even, more esoterically, the Freudian death drive, compelled towards destruction for destruction’s sake?

To be fair to Hobbes, he does admit that even the most perfectly constituted commonwealth, though it is designed for (artificial) immortality, will eventually wither – for such is the way of all things.

I must say that, while I perused the latter two divisions of the book, wherein Hobbes details his ideas of a ‘Christian Commonwealth’, I did not do so as depthfully as the first two divisions – for the simple reason that I didn’t find it as relevant.

In conclusion, this was a thought-provoking read that fully earns its place as amongst the classics of political philosophy – or even philosophy proper. It does not argue for one form of politics or the other, but goes some way towards showing a science of politics. Without getting bogged down in normative prescriptions for one form of political life over the other, Hobbes endeavours to show that man is indeed a political animal, explores how he is a political animal, and demonstrates why he is so and must be so. His proposed solution is as fundamental as the question he poses.",False,,,219,135,3.0,,3.0,en,"Thomas Hobbes’ ‘Leviathan’ written turmoil English Civil war – conflict caused precisely sort divided sovereignty rails seminal text.

لكن التخلص من سلطان الكنيسة كان مهم و كان هو مقدمة التخلص من سلطان الملوك لان السلطة الاستبدادية ديما أسهل من السلطة الدينية في التخلص .

المهم أن هوبز استوحي موقفه من الظروف دي ، خصوصا انه شاف أن اي مجتمع بيواجه خطرين الفوضي أو الاستبداد و كان بيشوف أن خطر الاستبداد اقل وطئة من الفوضي عشان كدا كان مؤيد ليه.

لكن الحقيقة أن الدول أوقات بتوصل حد من التحلل بيخلي استمرارها مستحيل زي فرنسا ١٧٨٩ و روسيا ١٩١٧ ، + أن امان الحكومات من اي تحرك للشعب بيخليها تلغي مصلحة العامة اصلا لان الدولة الحديثه بتخدم المواطن لسبب البقاء في السلطة في الاساس ، فخوف هوبز من نتائج الفوضي بيتحقق اصلا في نظريته!

He then started to talk about the government of a commonwealth. he laid out what a monarch is supposed to do and what power he is supposed to have and stuff like that. This is a little bit irrelevant to today's world, but you can see his logic is still self consistent. For example, he explains tyranny is not a different form of government than monarchy. We call it that way when we don't like it.

And then he started to talk about the Christian commonwealth. This part is the longest, hardest part to endure. He did his homework, I give you that. He extensively quotes the scripture. But here, his logic completely breaks down. He can still be logical: he mentioned multiple times that you can not just trust anyone who claims revelation from God. But somewhere in those long chapters (I did the audiobook and couldn't pin down where), he sneaked past axioms after axioms all worded as if they follow natural logic. Remember, this is the same person who told us you can't believe someone is a prophet simply because he said so himself. But now, in discussing the little details about how to run a christian common wealth (e.g., relationship between civil sovereign and religious head of church), what does it mean to be an incorporeal spirit, whether there is a purgatory, etc. etc., there is no doubting anything in the bible. His logic boils down to this: don't believe any wacko claiming to be a messiah or prophet; but you can believe the christian theology; this is *because* the church blessed it. Don't forget the circularity that the church has the influence because many people believed in it.

Somewhere in there, I think I read the confession that he basically said I believe this stuff because what choice do you have? Everybody else does.

156,Fred Dameron,"Leviathan is definitely a ""Know your enemy as yourself"" book. The GOP uses Hobbes as justification of small to one man government that can be ""Drowned in a bathtub"". Unfortunately, for the GOP and religious right fanatics, Hobbes's Leviathan is not the justification the majority of the GOP theologizes it is. In many ways Leviathan is much like the cornerstone book of GOP political theory that their pundits continue to quote, The Bible. And they quote both out of context and incorrectly. In the case of The Bible the most famous is ""An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."" (Exodus 21:24) but if you look at the VERY specific circumstances of this punishment ""If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise."" (Exodus 21: 22-26) NIV. You find that this justification for the death penalty is only in this one case and not as a general justification for the State to take a life.

For instance many Republicans like New Justice Neil Gorsuch who said a month ago, and I paraphrase, It's is Ok for a municipality to have a Nativity scene in front of city hall and exclude other religions from posting a holiday scene as we are a Christian Nation."" The Founding Fathers read Leviathan. Part IV is an attack on a State run by a Religious leader. Now Hobbes is attacking the Papal States which had the Pope not only as Spiritual Leader of the Catholic Church but also there temporal leader. Starting with Matthew 10:154 and Mark 6:11 ""that if a town does not accept you when you leave knock the dust from your sandal."" This leaves the Church with only one way to change people and that is by PERSUASION. Now if a ruler is also a Temporal authority that ruler may ALSO COMPEL his/her subjects to one religion. This is why the Founding Fathers added to the Constitution the Bill of Rights and why the First Amendment says ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. This is NOT Freedom of Religion and a statement of a ""Christian Nation"" as the Rt wing of the GOP would state, but is Freedom FROM religion as the last 80 pages of Leviathan states. Hobbes is very specific That the Church can not punish (Section III CH XLII Paragraph 124, That a Church that tries to rule as a sovereign is ""The Kingdom of Fairies"" (Section IV CH XLVII paragraph 4-17). This is continued to the point that a Sovereign, either individual or Congressional/Parliamentary body, tries to rule with the authority of ecclesiastical and temporal authority is not only trying to lead to a civil war, (Part III CH XXXIX Par 5), but this Civil War is inevitable. Not only does Hobbes discus Civil War but also states that those leaders condemn themselves to Hell while they preach God's Word. Again, specifically aimed at the Pope but applicable to todays RT. Wing Religious Fanatics who want a ""Christian America.""( Section IV, CH XLIV paragraph 1) This may make some of you a little queasy as you have given up your right to think and turned it over to the propagandists of the GOP and or the inflammatory oration of Rt. Wing preachers who preach a false doctrine. I encourage you to actually READ both the Bible, all the way through, and the source documents your party uses as the touch stone of their political theology. Leviathan is this touch stone and foundation work that the GOP uses, but they use it out of context and incorrectly.

There are also some things that I would like to see the U.S. take from Hobbes and Leviathan manly the way he ranks crime.

Crimes are ranked in severity by how many people they affect and how badly those affected are harmed. First all crimes are serious and deserving of punishment. Second the more severe the worse the punishment and finally the worst crime is RAPE OF A MOTHER, the Second WORST CRIME IS RAPE OF A WOMEN. The comes murder. Now in this country we all know that rape is not only under reported but also under prosecuted when it is reported. But, in a Hobbesian world rape would be the most prosecuted crime and a women word would be held over a mans. Also Hobbes points out that a crime committed against a small man is more serious than a crime committed against a great man. The reason being that the great man, as long as the crime is committed against property, can better afford the lose than the small man. Therefore since the sovereign is obligated to protect ALL his citizens he must also ensure that the small man is not taken advantage of by the great man. Again another point where the GOP has ignored or misinterpreted Leviathan. (Part II, CH XXVII, Paragraph 36 - 54) Lastly lets quickly look at Taxes and Private Armies. In taxes the small man should pay but the Great Man should pay more. Again because the Great Man has more resources and therefore paying of the tax should not affect him as much as the small man is hurt by unfair taxes.(Part II CH XXX Paragraph 17) As for the privatization of Armies, a plan that the U.S. DOD seems to be heading in. Private Armies tend to become real forces inside the country rather than being used by the Sovereign for defense. And when these private Armies become this powerful it is incumbent on the Sovereign to dismantle them so they do NOT pose a threat to the Nation or the Sovereign. A point that the DOD is getting further from in the use of extraordinary rendition and the privatization of forces like Blackwell and KBR.(Part II CH XXIX Paragraph 21) All these small private force that have sprung up since 9/11 need to be dismantled per Leviathan for our, the citizenry, own safety.

If you are a Republican I've been hard on you, but by failing to think critically you have given up complaining. I would suggest you actually read Leviathan and The Bible cover to cover and to audit classes held at your local University so you get an educated view of what has been written. If you a Democrat you also need to do the same . We need to fight the RT Wing extremists using their own words and their own source documents. Many of these people don't know how to actually cite a source to a level that would be barley acceptable for a Freshman writing course. (I know that I have not cited any of my sources in an acceptable MLA or ACA format, but this is a quick (?) review of a 350 year old work and I wasn't going to be bothered with breaking out my MLA manual.) And when confronted with actual facts fold like a cheap house of cards. We must continually confront those who have given their critical thinking skills to the pundits, who only repeat RT Wing irrational thought, and who use all the foundation documents that the GOP uses with no regard to what they actually say, and tell them what is actually said in the words I n red and what is actually said in those foundation documents the GOP has abused.

157,John Wiswell,"Fascism is treated more like a dirty word than a school of thought these days, so it's interesting to read a book that could lead to it. Fascism is a system that makes the state or government the ultimate authority, and Hobbes is clearly up for this with his unquestionable sovereigns - nearly every argument he makes for a monarch work for all fascists. He argues towards total order and submission at the expense of civil rights, and designs his government to control labor, economy and religion. He makes clear that the purpose of the sovereign state is to serve its people, but he denies the people the right to revolt or even demand change in government. His arguments are exhaustive, and he tries his best to obey reason rather than divine right at all corners, harkening to the concepts of social contract and anarchy (the horrors of the latter are tamped down in modern society, but were much more salient in his Europe). Yet for his good intentions (everyone wants a stable, positive society), his disregard for the lower class and loose legal morals (for instance, he does not observe duress as undermining or violating contracts) are downright terrifying. His ultimate assessment of human beings as motivated by fear, greed and ego is cynical and possibly insulting, but to be fair those things have shown up and caused almost every war and the corruption of almost every government in world history. In his estimation philosophy, religion, money and such things are vehicles for the true inspirations, which I can accept, and personally I know that I have fear, greed and egotistic impulses, though not necessarily in the degree or manner he describes. Others may reject it outright. But if you take it that he's working with worst-case imagination for ultimate peace, you can begin to understand his authoritarian stance.

In a philosophical atmosphere dominated by Cartesian metaphysics and epistemology, Hobbes' emphasis on the way we use language, rather than ""clear and distinct ideas"" is simply mind blowing. Hobbes, like Descartes, was interested in laying some ""extra-scientific"" foundation for the new sciences of Newton and Gallileo.

In this sense, it anticipated ""The Elimination of Metaphysics through the Logical Analysis of Language"" by 4 long centuries.

While Hobbes' political theory is wrought with the very ambiguities he sought to destroy in philosophical and scientific discourse (e.g. what concretely constitutes the ""leviathan"" and the ""soveriegn""), the ties between language and political theory stayed unexamined for a number of decades, if not centuries.

165,N Perrin,"Hobbes' Leviathan (1651) is perhaps the greatest work of political philosophy written in the English language. Those who roundly condemn Hobbes as the progenitor of totalitarianism should not overlook one of the most significant philosophical works of Western history, a book whose reinvention of concepts such as reason, sovereignty, right, and liberty remains commonplace today. It is no wonder that premier historians such as Quentin Skinner, Richard Tuck, and Noel Malcolm should be fascinated by the man.

A brief aside before I describe the book itself, Hobbes is usually only remembered for this one book, but his accomplishments range widely beyond Leviathan. Hobbes was heavily engaged in the scientific discourse of the time and wrote and conducted experiments widely in physics, chemistry, and optics. Hobbes was fluent in German, Italian, Latin, and Greek, and he created authoritative translations of Thucydides and Homer. Additionally, he was the first Englishman to engage in humanist biblical criticism and employs its hermeneutical methodologies. To be fair, he was only able to develop expert-level contributions to fields as far flung as physiology and mathematics because he lived to the age of 91 which was more than twice the life expectancy, but he arguably possesses the most impressive resume of the seventeenth century.

One more anecdote: Hobbes loathed the university systems in England and their fetishistic subservience to Aristotelianism. At one point he openly declared that he was superior in mathematics than all of the scholars of Oxford put together, and this began a rather amusing war of words with the university (which for some reason felt the need to respond to this challenge) over who really was more skilled.

But to get to Leviathan. Even if the West wholly condemns absolutism and many more Hobbesian political arguments, what is still fascinating is the extent to which his ideas are become the firmament on which all subsequent Western discourse has been built. For example, he argues that human beings are fundamentally creatures directed toward self-preservation and must use their reason to calculate the means toward that end while also balancing out the desires of their passions. Within that sentence you can find traces of Rousseau, Adam Smith, Darwin, et al. (Max Weber's concept of instrumental reason arguably emerges here in Hobbes).

Other familiar assertions emerge throughout the Leviathan. While they are commonplace assumptions now, they were novel at the time.
-All men are created equal (ch. 13)
-Liberty is the absence of external impediments to one's desire (ch. 14)
-The commonwealth is created by a gathering of the people who elect a sovereign by a popular vote of the majority which confers the right of authority onto the person of the sovereign (ch. 18)

Hobbes develops a sophisticated system to develop his political thought, defining concepts like sovereignty, representation, and person which would be crucial for the development of democracy. Furthermore, he introduces the understanding of an abstract person which can stand for another individual or group of people. While this hardly seems novel, this understanding of legal representation by proxy would lay the foundations for corporate law especially through his elaboration of how private systems and companies can count as legal persons. (David Armitage also points out how Hobbes' legal philosophy laid the foundations for international law as well.)

The sheer thoroughness and rigor of Hobbes' argumentation is astounding. Inspired by Euclid's Elements, Hobbes applied the deductive method to his political philosophy, and the results are undoubtedly impressive. But this is not merely a work of political philosophy, that would only account for 200 of the 500 pages which comprise this mammoth tome.

Throughout the second half of the book, Hobbes dives into thorough biblical and theological analysis, and the sheer effort exerted on proclaiming the supremacy of Christ and his kingdom should call claims about Hobbes the atheist into question. Hobbes explores the validity of the canon, analyzes key theological concepts using astonishingly thorough biblical cross-referencing, and touches upon theological debates ranging from soteriology to sacramentology to demonology to ecclesiology.

Partway through chapter 46, Hobbes also decides to begin a point-by-point refutation of Aristotle's pihlosophy and provides extensive arguments against Aristotle's theory of logic, metaphysics, physics, psychology, and politics. He then unpacks the extent to which Aristotelian and other pagan traditions have infiltrated the Roman Catholic tradition (while also weighing in on contemporary Catholic debates such as the conciliarist discussions of the authority of the Pope over bishops).

He ends by drawing out an extended comparison between Roman Catholicism and the Kingdom of Fairies often described in old wives' tales. (While also dense, Hobbes' prose is rife with witty sarcasm, savage burns, and no small degree of humor.) I'll also conclude this review by quoting from this rewarding end to his book:

""The Fairies are not to be seized on; and brought to answer for the hurt they do. So also the Ecclesiastiques vanish away from the Tribunals of Civill Justice. [...] When the Fairies are displeased with any body, they are said to send their Elves, to pinch them. The Ecclesiastiques, when they are displeased with any Civill State, make also their Elves, that is, Superstitious, Enchanted Subjects, to pinch their Princes [...]

To this, and such like resemblances between the Papacy, and the Kingdom of Fairies, may be added this, that as the Fairies have no existence, but in the Fancies of ignorant people, rising from the Traditions of old wives, or old Poets; so the Spirituall Power of the Pope consisteth onely in the Fear that Seduced people stand in, of their Excommunication; upon hearing of false Miracles, false Traditions, and false Interpretations of Scripture.""

175,Anto Pujol,"El libro está dividido en cuatro partes:
I. Del hombre. Ocupa el 75% del libro. Me imagino a Hobbes como un señor mayor acurrucado delante de su chimenea refunfuñando de todo, sentando cátedra de cómo son las cosas, y que todo aquél que no siga su método o esté de acuerdo con sus conclusiones es porque está alejado de la verdad. Sí que hay alguna cosa que me ha gustado: ""En todas vuestras acciones, considerad frecuentemente aquello que queréis poseer, porque es la cosa que dirige todos vuestros pensamientos al camino para alcanzarlo.""
""El valor o estimación del hombre es, como el de todas las demás cosas, su precio; es decir, tanto como sería dado por el uso del poder. Por consiguiente, no es absoluto sino una consencuencia de la necesidad del jucio de otro.""

Habla de algunos conceptos: el derecho de naturaleza, que es la libertad de cada hombre de usar su propio poder como quiera, para la conservación de su propia naturaleza (su propia vida); la libertad, que se entiende como ausencia de impedimento externos; y la ley de la naturaleza, que es lo que impide a un hombre hacer lo que puede destruir su vida o privarle de los medios de conservarla, o bien omitir aquello mediante lo cual piensa que pueda quedar su vida mejor preservada. A partir de ahí, dice que ""cada hombre tiene derecho a hacer cualquier cosa, incluso en el cuerpo de los demás. Y, por consiguiente, mientras persiste ese derecho natural de cada uno con respecto a todas las cosas, no puede haber seguridad para nadie de existir durante todo el tiempo que ordinariamente la Naturaleza permite vivir a los hombres."" por lo que cada hombre tiene que esforzarse por la paz, y si no lo consigue, pues a la guerra.

""La definición de injusticiano es otra sino esta: el incumplimiento de un pacto"". Da mucha importancia al contrato/promesa/pacto como base de las relaciones humanas. Pero no nos engañemos, que el pacto no se mantiene porque somos buenesitos, sino que los pactos se mantiene por la amenaza de las armas.

II. Del Estado. Junto con la parte final de la parte anterior, esta la parte más interesante del libro. Se parece mucho al Príncipe de Maquiavelo. Militarista, monárquico y religioso. En esta parte sobre todo destaca la parte de monárquico y militarista. ""Siendo indivisible esta gran autoridad, y yendo inseparablemente aneja a la soberanía, existe poca razón para la opinión de quienes dicen que aunque los reyes soberanos sean singulis maiores, o sea, de mayor poder que cualquiera de sus súbditos, son universis minores, es decir, de menor poder que todos ellos juntos."" Me recuerda al Juramento de les reyes aragoneses: ""Nos, que somos y valemos tanto como vos, pero juntos más que vos, os hacemos Principal, Rey y Señor entre los iguales, con tal que guardéis nuestros fueros y libertades; y si no, no”. Aunque le quita un poco la gracia de que el Rey es elegido por dios y que por eso no lo votamos.

""Si un súbdito tiene una controversia con su soberano acerca de una deuda, o del derecho de poseer tierras, o bienes, o acerca de cualqueir servicio requerido de sus manos, o respecto a cualquier pena corporal o pecuniaria fundada en una ley procedente, el súbdito tiene la misma libertad para defender su derecho como si su antagonista fuera otro súbdito, y puede realizar esa defensa ante los jueces designados por el soberano."" Parece bastante poco absolutista, pero que el Rey elija a los jueces jeje.

III. De un estado cristiano. Sin más.

IV. Del reino de las tinieblas. Es un poco clickbait del siglo XVII. ""Lo que ofende a los individuos no es que estén gobernados como cada uno de ellos desearía por si mismo, sino como considera adecuado el representante público, ya sea un hombre o una asamblea de hombres, es decir, por un gobierno arbitrario: por ello dan nombres desagradables a su ssuperiores ignorando (hasta acaso un poco después de una guerra civil) que sin tal gobierno arbitrario semejante estado de guerra será perpetuo y que es el hombres y sus armas, y no las palabras y las promesas, lo que afirma la fortaleza y el poder de las leyes"".

El libro termina de una forma que no me esperaba: ""haced que sean silenciados también y castigados los maestros en virtud del poder de aquel a quien está encomendada la tutela de la tranquilidad pública, es decir, por la autoridad civil: porque cualquier género de potestad que lo eclesiásticos asuman (en algún lugar donde estén sujetos al Estado) en su propio derecho, aunque lo denominen derecho divino, no es sino usurpación.

Todo el libro pensando que es un señoro absolutista monárquico cristiano para que al final me dé cuenta de que durante todo momento estaba haciendo una distinción entre el poder religioso y el poder civil. Podría volver a leerlo con esta otra perspectiva, pero no me ape. No sé si he terminado de cuadrar por dónde va Hobbes en todo momento.

Uprooted from its context, Hobbes’ treatise is a mostly dry, taxing, moribund dungeon-crawl through the musty precincts of Christian Monarchism (though his game-mechanics for playing a Commonwealth are flexible enough for a democratic Assembly, clinching the book’s rep as the cobwebbed grandfather clock of modern political theory). Walking its crypts and vaults, past the derelict waxworks of a political theology gone to seed, with its churchy old-man-smell of smug pedantry and dyspeptic griping, is a book that bores far more often than it captivates, a book one is tempted to finish only to earn the “Yeah I read the f*** out of it” merit badge, but by the final installment (Book IV: “Of The Kingdome of Darknesse”) becomes peculiarly entrancing, even uproarious. For in context, Hobbes is a gamechanger and apostate, a burr in the sock of both royalist and liberal, for knotty and disparate reasons.

Stirred by the terror of English Civil War, mirrors said conflict in a Jekyll-Hyde upheaval of Mechanism vs. Revelation. Though its author was hardly an unbeliever, his God does not seem to be an active, intercessory force in the (post-biblical) world, but rather the divine author of natural laws which undergird our materialist psychology. This shocking disconnect helped blackball Hobbes an untrustworthy cynic and infidel, while peppering his treatise with some odd and amusing vindications of scriptural nuttiness. See for example Chap. 37, “Of Miracles, and their use”, on the wacktastic showdown in 7-8: where Pharaoh’s elite necromancers go toe-with-toe with Yahweh in a Hogwartsy wizard’s duel. Hobbes suspects that the Egyptian counterstrikes were blockbuster feats of sneaky, non-magical special FX!

“If therefore Enchantment be not, as many think it, a working of strange effects by spells, and words, but Imposture, and delusion wrought by ordinary means; and so far from supernaturall operation, as the Impostors need not the study so much of naturall causes, but the ordinary ignorance, stupidity, and superstition of mankind, to do them; those texts that seem to countenance the power of Magick, Witchcraft, and Enchantment must needs have another sense, than at first sight they seem to bear.”

In a later chapter, “Of Spirituall Darknesse,” the buckshot cracks from his anti-Papist boom-stick, comparing the Bread and Wine of transubstantiation to the “Onyons and Leeks” of Moses-era Egyptian alchemists. By chapter 47, “Of the Benefit that proceedeth from such Darknesse, and to whom it accreweth,” Hobbes’ smirky blitzkrieg of trolling rebukes the Roman ecclesiastical mafia as a “Kingdome of Fairies” (not a typo, he actually calls them Fairies) who’ve grifted their flock in a string of devious power-grabs, largely rolled back by Henry VIII and Elizabeth I (Hobbes’ viagra boner for Monarchy is inexorable). The riffing that ensues is so George Carlinesque I excerpt it in full at the very end of this review.

Cynical realism huffing on all cylinders came easy to Hobbes, as in his prevailing vision of “the natural state of Man” as an ego-blitzed pandemonium of All against All...



…which fatally misjudges our groupish, social, and tribal instincts…



…though in the overstuffed evidence-locker of history, there’s enough sectarian mass murder to make -caliber statism sound like the lesser evil to 17th-century ears. (The dictatorship of Saddam Hussein was criminal and oppressive, and dissent could land you in a torture chamber, but the probability of a family member being torn to meat-confetti by car-bomb shrapnel at the farmer’s market was close to zero.)

Hanging another bullseye on his back, Hobbes considered the doctrines of Hell and Purgatory to be spurious and unfounded (angels, spirits, and devils also get tossed down the FAIL chute), and concluded that theology should bend its knee to civil power, to preempt scorched-earth cycles of religious civil war. This led him to argue that if Britain were invaded by, say, a Mujahideen armada, and His Majesty’s Isles annexed to the Caliphate, Christian martyrdom may be deferred, and civic loyalty shifted, to the new Mahometan overlord, without tremor of conscience.(!) Of course, fealty to Christ would be passionately maintained, inwardly, and true believers could cash in their wad of Skee-Ball tickets in the afterlife, but for the greater worldly good of a stable hegemony, the conquered Britains may turn the other cheek and accept Sharia civil law, if they lack the stomach to emulate their savior’s bloodletting.

Though Hobbes was being a stark realist here, you can probably envision how this train of thought made his critics’ heads explode. Why not “bide one’s time” until the new sovereign is vulnerable to a coup? Well, he reasoned, because this might perpetuate endless tit-for-tat Hatfield-McCoy blood vendettas that would make the elevator scene in look like a pinky-finger cholesterol test. Besides, the Apostolic Fathers never tried to supplant Claudius or Nero, for their Kingdom was not of this world. In Hobbes’ moral cosmos, once a monarch fails in his primary duty to protect his subjects, the social contract is dookie paper.

Democracy contends that virtuous stewardship can curdle into tyranny without checks-and-balances on power, inflaming sedition and undermining the core argument for Kingship – pacifism, order, and unity. The monarchist would fire back that “checks-and-balances” can lead to crippling policy gridlock and a grievously-underinformed electorate polarized by hate -- frothy ecstasies of righteous indignation that divide and conquer from within. (Though bemoaning “the failures of democracy” seems to be an enduring feature of democratic life, in all eras.)

More perplexing still, ’s alleged Absolutism is seeded with precursory notions of individual rights, government by the consent of the governed, and the natural equality of all men, planting the memes that would help downgrade “the Sovereign” to tabloid fodder centuries on. Today’s reader may have to squint to see these tiny buds dimpling the rooty topsoil, but they’re there, and several revolutions later, we’re here. ’s worldweary apology for despotic collectivism carries the destruct codes of its eventual dissolution.

Study Question: What would Hobbes think of our current demoralized state, having yielded to plutarchical financiers and their nightmare Ponziverse of debt-inflated fiat currency pumped into rigged markets? To rogue leviathans not democratically accountable to the Commonwealth because they own its presumed representatives, most mass-media, and the major Economics departments from which policy heads are recruited? I’d love for some clever SF writer to crank out a neo-Hobbesian satire on the return of monarchical command-economies to try and deflate our mushrooming debtocalypse of phantom currency. A post-Singularity A.I. as ultra-Kantian philosopher-king?

Hobbes reserves his greatest punchline for ’s very last paragraph, baldly declaring that no one interested in “Truth” could ever find his arguments problematic. This parting snort of irony in the face of explosive inbound controversy has all the crotch-kicking charm of “Bring it you f***ers!”

And oh they brung it.

For reconstructing the world where its author was sniped as “the Monster of Malmesbury” and “the bug-bear of the nation”, the Norton Critical Ed. is invaluable. Anti-Hobbesian invective, past and present, is an enriching livewire of commentary that will help tune and lube anyone’s ideological engine (‘specially Ren Faire LARPers who want to polish their pro-monarchist dinner prattle). Just be aware that it’s an abridged edition, dumping much of the Christian apologia, specifically chapters 22, 23, 34-36, 38-42, and 45. For those of sterner fortitude, I recommend the Continuum Classic Texts edition edited by G.A.J. Rogers and Karl Schuhmann, if the prospect of Hobbes as Bible College tutor and ecclesiastical reformist wonk sounds like your style of masochism.





Clive Barker’s “In the Hills, In the Cities”

Just because. =)













The Language also, which they use, both in the Churches and in their Publique Acts, being Latine, which is not commonly used by any Nation now in the world, what is it but the Ghost of the old Romane Language?

The Fairies in what Nation soever they converse, have but one Universall King, which some Poets of ours call King Oberon; but the Scripture calls Beelzebub, Prince of Daemons. The Ecclesiastiques likewise, in whose Dominions soever they be found, acknowledge but one Universall King, the Pope.

The Ecclesiastiques are Spirituall men, and Ghostly Fathers. The Fairies are Spirits, and Ghosts. Fairies and Ghosts inhabit Darknesse, Solitudes, and Graves. The Ecclesiastiques walk in Obscurity of Doctrine, in Monasteries, Churches, and Church-yards.

The Ecclesiastiques have their Cathedrall Churches; which, in what Towne soever they be erected, by vertue of Holy Water, and certain Charms called Exorcismes, have the power to make those Townes, Cities, that is to say, Seats of Empire. The Fairies also have their enchanted Castles, and certain Gigantique Ghosts, that domineer over the Regions round about them.

The Fairies are not to be seized on; and brought to answer for the hurt they do. So also the Ecclesiastiques vanish away from the Tribunals of Civill Justice.

The Ecclesiastiques take from young men the use of Reason, by certain charms compounded of Metaphysiques, and Miracles, and Traditions, and Abused Scripture, whereby they are good for nothing else, but to execute what they command them. The Fairies likewise are said to take young Children out of their Cradles, and to change them into Naturall Fools, which Common people do therefore call Elves, and are apt to mischief.

In what Shop, or Operatory the Fairies make their Enchantment, the old Wives have not determined. But the Operatories of the Clergy, are well enough known to be the Universities, that received their Discipline from Authority Pontificall.

When the Fairies are displeased with any body, they are said to send their Elves, to pinch them. The Ecclesiastiques, when they are displeased with any Civill State, make also their Elves, that is, Superstitious, Enchanted Subjects, to pinch their Princes, by preaching Sedition; or one Prince, enchanted with promises, to pinch another.

The Fairies marry not; but there be amongst them Incubi, that have copulation with flesh and bloud. The Priests also marry not.

The Ecclesiastiques take the Cream of the Land, by Donations of ignorant men, that stand in aw of them, and by Tythes: So also it is in the Fable of Fairies, that they enter into the Dairies, and Feast upon the Cream, which they skim from the Milk.

What kind of Money is current in the Kingdom of Fairies, is not recorded in the Story. But the Ecclesiastiques in their Receipts accept of the same Money that we doe; though when they are to make any Payment, it is in Canonizations, Indulgences, and Masses.

To this, and such like resemblances between the Papacy and the Kingdome of Fairies, may be added this, that as the Fairies have no existence, but in the Fancies of ignorant people, rising from the Traditions of old Wives or old Poets: so the Spirituall Power of the Pope (without the bounds of his own Civill Dominion) consisteth only in the Fear that Seduced people stand in, of their Excommunications; upon hearing of false Miracles, false Traditions, and false Interpretations of the Scripture.

It was not therefore a very difficult matter, for Henry 8. by his Exorcisme; nor for Qu. Elizabeth by hers, to cast them out. But who knows that this Spirit of Rome, now gone out, and walking by Missions through the dry places of China, Japan, and the Indies, that yield him little fruit, may not return; or rather, an Assembly of Spirits worse than he enter and inhabite this clean swept house, and make the End thereof worse than the Beginning? For it is not the Romane Clergy onely, that pretends the Kingdome of God to be of this World, and thereby to have a Power therein, distinct from that of the Civill State.

195,Jacques Coulardeau,"I will only consider some chapters in this approach. The a priori position is that God is the origin of everything, that the Bible is absolutely true about the history of humanity and its “creation” and that the best order is that dictated by God’s law and order in which man is only free in the subjects and situations that have not been ruled out or regulated by God himself. This represents the situation in England in 1651 under the absolute rule of the Puritans led by Oliver Cromwell and named the Commonwealth. But the value for modern human beings can only come if we get the ideas he espouses out of this religious axiom that is like a pillory to his thinking.

The introduction takes us directly into the subject. The general idea he states is that man is the central element of his thinking and this man is positioned in nature. We will have to clarify what he means by nature later on. The idea here is that man as an organism, as an architectural construction is the basis of any other construction that develops from man, that is developed by man. He thus identifies what he calls Leviathan, or the common-wealth or state, as being built on the model of our body and the concept of “sovereignty” is stated to be an “artificial soul.” This metaphor, because it is a metaphor, is even densified by comparing this Leviathan created by man to a simple machine or watch or clock, hence a complex mechanism created by man too. When we bring in the concept of God as the creator of man to his own image we feel a contradiction. Man creates Leviathan or a watch to his own image, not God’s, though this man who is the model of the creations we are speaking of is the image of God, hence Leviathan should be the image of the image of God. Yet Hobbes divides his discourse between nature that governs or should govern us in daily life, man and his civil dimension that organizes the common-wealth for peace and prosperity, and God and the religious principles that govern the ultimate human society and morality. We have the impression God is something added to the previous two levels of nature and man and that it is a sort of wrapping up that reminds us of the creative dimension of this God and of the superior ethical dimension of this God. But the whole discourse has to do with the reality of nature and the civil society organized in some common-wealth and state. In fact, we could consider this approach as very modern if we just set aside the divine supplement and we see that man is extending his own body and his own capabilities into everything he does or creates. In fact we have here the basic concept of the “extensions of man” developed by Marshall McLuhan.

I will then consider chapter 4 that deals with Speech. His starting point is that printing is not such a tremendous invention. He totally neglects the tremendous impact it had on education and all levels of social life, religion, politics, culture, and many others. This is surprising since his book is such an intervention in the field of politics and ethics that is bound to have an impact due to the number of copies that are going to be circulated. But instead of seeing what was caused by the printing press, he goes back in time (a typical and unscientific retrospective method) and considers that the invention of writing was a lot more important than printing. He traces alphabetical writing back to the Phoenicians, which is not false indeed, though that was not the invention of writing per se since there were non alphabetical writing systems before this one. This Phoenician invention reached us through the Greek alphabet. He has a good point there because Homo Sapiens started emerging 300,000 years ago and writing was only invented something like a little bit more than 5,000 years ago. He is right when he speaks of isolating the sounds of speech to represent them with letters that become some kind of conceptual written forms of the isolated sounds. We are here at the root of modern phonemics and phonetics.

He is more surprising by the fact that he still goes back to speech, oral speech. He sticks to the idea of the speech incentive and energy being given to Adam by God though God gave Adam the mission of naming everything, and he considers this speech invention as “the most noble and profitable invention.” In spite of his referring to the Babel Tower myth, he clearly states here speech is an invention of man himself using his “tongue, Palat, lips, and other organs of speech” to produce it, though God is the real “author of speech.” The objective is to “register thoughts.” We can see he is modern in a way since he connects speech to the body though he ignores the larynx and other elements in the body that were developed not for speech but for bipedal long distance fast running. What is important is that he sees the organs he names as the organs of speech implying they were developed to produce speech, which is not the case at all. At the same time speech is used by man to register thoughts for sure but were do these thoughts come from? And by what process are words and sentences with syntactic and paradigmatic architectures produced? It is quite obvious that his reference to God and the Babel Tower myth is nothing but a necessary reference in his society and the fact that God is the author of speech while man is the inventor of it shows we can just get God out and say that the necessity to have a common-wealth to permit the survival of the species requires some kind of communication and man being what he is he uses his physiological resources to produce and invent language, speech if you want. The “author” is the necessary social dimension of man’s life and survival when emerging several hundred thousand years ago. That’s what he could call a “Law of Nature” as we are going to see. God is only a name glued to it and I wonder if it was only opportunistic or really believed.

He is very modern on the uses of language: to register past or present thoughts, findings and the acquisition of arts (old meaning of crafts and artistic productions); to communicate knowledge to others; to give orders and instructions; for pleasure. His conception of speech is centered on “names”, both “proper” or “common universal.” And he reduces what we are (“wise” or “foolish”) to the meaning of the words we use, neglecting the fact that the mind (what we are, wise or foolish) is just like language, it is developed from experience, through experience and by the invention and use of language which develops in the same way through that process.

For him names can designate things, material or sensible and rational, hot or cold, moving or quiet. Then they can indicate the accidents or qualities we perceive in things, both concrete or abstract. And this is done through the properties of our own body. The eyes gives sight that perceives color that becomes our idea or fancy of it in the considered thing. The ears give hearing that perceives sound that becomes our idea, fancy or conception of it, from noise to music. His approach is very interpretative and not genetic. The final use of names, hence of speech, is to be the meta-language describing language itself. As he says names can be “general, universal, special or equivocal” and speeches can be “an affirmation, an interrogation, a commandment; a narration; a syllogism, a sermon, an oration and many others.” Here “speech” means either an utterance (sentence) or a discourse that can be one or several sentences. He even concludes that names are “inconstant” because they reflect the moods and states of mind of the speaker. All that is modern, refuses a frozen and congealed language but once again it is connected to circumstantial use, though there is no dialectic that would state the mind and language develop together one with the other, one development in the mind causing one development in language and vice versa. The approach then is very utilitarian: what we can use language for. That’s why he consider abuses of language which is one particular type of use and nothing else since the basic abuses of language are to say something that is a lie, hence not true, or to aggress and insult people.

If we turn to chapters 14 and 15 we come to the “Laws of Nature” that are in fact the central piece of this book. Let me list them with some comment. First he defines the “right of nature” which is the fact that an individual has the right to do anything he needs to do in order to defend his life. This is the survival instinct but exclusively at the level of the individual. This is important because he does not see the fact that the species per se has a survival instinct and that human beings cannot survive as a species if they do not organize their life collectively. In other words he misses the concept of survival instinct. Then he has to define his concept of “liberty” and it is for him “the absence of external impediments” which is a purely negative definition and he is going to show that such impediments are natural, implying there is no liberty, a conclusion he would absolutely refuse. He has to define the concept of “law” that he opposes to that of “right.” A law gives an obligation for him, whereas a right is a liberty for him. It sounds weird since a right is also established by society and its laws and regulations. He misses history that imposes onto people some limitations and opens to people some possible actions, hence some duties (have to do or have not to do) and some rights (can or may do). But this being said he can consider the laws of nature which are what the consideration of nature implies as for the organization of man’s life.

1- The first law of nature is that every man needs peace or otherwise it is a constant state of war for their individual survival (one against all).
2- The second law of nature is the reciprocal limitation of “the right to all things” to ensure peace. This is what he calls a covenant with the religious reference behind though these covenants are purely human and in no way divine. It is the simple observation that human beings ALWAYS live in groups of various types and even the individuals who live absolutely alone do so in reference to the groups they move out of and away from.
3- The third law of nature is that men have to perform their covenants. He comes then to a simple definition of “just” (what respects covenants) and “unjust” (what goes against covenants). Justice is then the keeping of covenants, hence and therefore the rule of reason. He states though there must be a coercive power to compel men equally to perform covenants. That is where the concept of common-wealth appears.
4- The fourth law of nature is gratitude.
5- The fifth law of nature is natural accommodation or complaisance.
6- The sixth law of nature is the facility to pardon.
7- The seventh law of nature is that in revenges man must respect only the future good.
8- The eighth law of nature is against men’s contumely contempt to one another.
9- The ninth law of nature is against pride.
10- The tenth law of nature is against arrogance.
11- The eleventh law of nature is equity, to proceed equally when dealing with various men.
12- The twelfth law of nature is the equal use by all of things that are common to all.
13- The thirteenth law of nature is “lot,” i.e. the priority of anything to first possession or possessor.
14- The fourteenth law of nature is Primogeniture and first seizing.
15- The fifteenth law of nature is about mediators.
16- The sixteenth law of nature is about one’s submission to arbitrament and arbitrators.
17- The seventeenth law of nature is the fact that no man can be his own judge
18- The eighteenth law of nature is No man can be a judge who has in himself a cause of partiality.
19- The nineteenth law of nature is about witnesses who are supposed to be as numerous as possible.

Hobbes adds a twentieth law of nature in his concluding remarks:

20- The twentieth law of nature is ""that every man is bound by Nature, as much as in him lieth, to protect in Warre, the Authority, by which he is himself protected in time of Peace.""

It is strange because it states clearly that the existing authority cannot be changed and that everyone is supposed to defend it if it is attacked. This is in full contradiction with the Puritan revolution that attacked the Authority of the King, though they will object that they represented the authority of Parliament that was under attack from the King, but then the Civil war was necessary since the supporters of each authority had the natural obligation to fight for it. What’s more it implies that the Puritan Common-wealth cannot be changed and that all people will have to fight if an attempt is done to change it. Historically this principle is de facto unacceptable. The restoration took place and later the Glorious Revolution took place and the Jacobites were declared illegal and traitors.

We have to point out these laws of nature are based on individualistic considerations. They are laws of nature governing every individual and the social and political facts are only the consequences of this first principle. The second remark is that they are deeply anti-historical. If these laws of nature are the basic covenant of all human commonwealths, if respecting or implementing the covenant is the only basis for justice and finally if “the laws of justice are eternal,” meaning the laws that are devised in application and continuation of the twenty laws of nature, the very essence of any covenant which is the only basis for justice, then there is no possible historical change, which is absurd. He even goes further and declares that “the science of these laws is true moral philosophy.” Such laws are not a science. They are only his own reasoning, hence at best a theory. True enough we are dealing with ethics and nothing else but ethics are not and cannot be “true” because they depend on too many personal choices that have nothing to do with truth, except that they are true at one particular moment in one particular situation for one particular person. And even when one of these ethical elements has been instated as a basic human right, for example the right to enter a same sex alliance, marriage or not, no one is forced to do it: it is a basic human right for those who choose to implement it for themselves. In other words gay marriage is not becoming compulsory for everyone just because it is considered today as a basic human right. Note in the same way that plain marriage of any type is not compulsory either though it is a basic human right.

Then his discussion of “liberty” reveals a lot about his own philosophy.

1- For him liberty is purely individualistic.

2- For him liberty is defined negatively: absence of opposition, “not hindered to do what he has a will to do.” Note here the “he” pronoun is also very meaningful: he does not consider women, just as he does not consider blacks (who are slaves in the colonies), or Indians (who are being slaughtered already in the colonies) or even the Irish who are being ruthlessly colonized) and probably a few more like all Catholics, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus.

3- For him it is based on the fear of the law as the incentive to liberty, since liberty and necessity are consistent and here comes his basic religious fundamentalism: man has to do what God wants him to do and man has not to do what God does not want him to do, and beyond these two obligations (to do and not to do) man can and may do what is not covered or included.

4- When he is dealing with the “liberty of subjects” he does not see the contradiction between “liberty” and “subject” (someone who is subjected to another, who submits to the authority of another), even when he asserts “the liberty of sovereigns.” The only important liberty he asserts is the liberty for any man to defend his own body and body’s integrity. This is the Habeas Corpus principle that will only be passed in Parliament in 1679. For him the liberty of subjects is in the silence of the law. This asserts the power of Judicature. This is the premise of what will become with Montesquieu judicial power. But he does not understand how it works: you are tried in a first level lower court. You can then appeal to an appeal court. You can finally appeal to some “supreme court” (House of Lords in England, Supreme Court in the USA) and their decision will edict a total ban on one activity, a total freedom to practice it, or an in-between regulated practice. The best example is abortion and how the US Supreme Court made history for the fifty states by ruling on an attempt to reduce the right to abort for women in Texas. (SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, Syllabus: WHOLE WOMAN’S HEALTH ET AL. v. HELLERSTEDT, COMMISSIONER, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES, ET AL, CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT No. 15–274, Argued March 2, 2016—Decided June 27, 2016. , accessed August 19, 2016)

5- He concludes his book with a call for leniency from the Censors since “there is nothing in this whole Discourse, as far as I can perceive, contrary either to the Word of God, or to good Manners; or to the disturbance of the Publique Tranquillity. Therefore I think it may be profitably printed, and more profitably taught in the Universities.”

This book then is essential to prove the historicity of such concepts as “liberty,” “common-wealth,” including those I did not consider like “democracy,” “monarchy,” “aristocracy,” tyranny,” and “oligarchy” in the direct political field. In England per se we can see that some principles are becoming established: distance from the purely fundamentalist religious approach, the idea that any state organization and social organization are the results of covenants (what J.J. Rousseau will call one century later “social contracts”), the idea that any covenant is the result of some general historical rules that govern the survival of the human species, of any human group and of any human individual, and finally the idea that all human activities are governed by the ability of man to speak, communicate, imagine and create crafts, arts, and sciences. We could add religion that probably came as belief in the supernatural and in a higher level of determinism as soon as Homo Sapiens developed language that enabled him to start his trip on the road to conceptualization.

We are, within this Puritan Common-wealth, at a real round about in history. There are several roads emerging in front of us and choices are both free and determined by the context.

Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",True,24.0,28.0,,,5.0,1.0,,en,"I consider chapters approach. The priori position God origin everything, Bible absolutely true history humanity “creation” best order dictated God’s law order man free subjects situations ruled regulated God himself. This represents situation England 1651 absolute rule Puritans led Oliver Cromwell named Commonwealth. But value modern human beings come get ideas espouses religious axiom like pillory thinking. The introduction takes us directly subject. The general idea states man central element thinking man positioned nature. We clarify means nature later on. The idea man organism, architectural construction basis construction develops man, developed man. He thus identifies calls Leviathan, common-wealth state, built model body concept “sovereignty” stated “artificial soul.” This metaphor, metaphor, even densified comparing Leviathan created man simple machine watch clock, hence complex mechanism created man too. When bring concept God creator man image feel contradiction. Man creates Leviathan watch image, God’s, though man model creations speaking image God, hence Leviathan image image God. Yet Hobbes divides discourse nature governs govern us daily life, man civil dimension organizes common-wealth peace prosperity, God religious principles govern ultimate human society morality. We impression God something added previous two levels nature man sort wrapping reminds us creative dimension God superior ethical dimension God. But whole discourse reality nature civil society organized common-wealth state. In fact, could consider approach modern set aside divine supplement see man extending body capabilities everything creates. In fact basic concept “extensions man” developed Marshall McLuhan. I consider chapter 4 deals Speech. His starting point printing tremendous invention. He totally neglects tremendous impact education levels social life, religion, politics, culture, many others. This surprising since book intervention field politics ethics bound impact due number copies going circulated. But instead seeing caused printing press, goes back time (a typical unscientific retrospective method) considers invention writing lot important printing. He traces alphabetical writing back Phoenicians, false indeed, though invention writing per se since non alphabetical writing systems one. This Phoenician invention reached us Greek alphabet. He good point Homo Sapiens started emerging 300,000 years ago writing invented something like little bit 5,000 years ago. He right speaks isolating sounds speech represent letters become kind conceptual written forms isolated sounds. We root modern phonemics phonetics. He surprising fact still goes back speech, oral speech. He sticks idea speech incentive energy given Adam God though God gave Adam mission naming everything, considers speech invention “the noble profitable invention.” In spite referring Babel Tower myth, clearly states speech invention man using “tongue, Palat, lips, organs speech” produce it, though God real “author speech.” The objective “register thoughts.” We see modern way since connects speech body though ignores larynx elements body developed speech bipedal long distance fast running. What important sees organs names organs speech implying developed produce speech, case all. At time speech used man register thoughts sure thoughts come from? And process words sentences syntactic paradigmatic architectures produced? It quite obvious reference God Babel Tower myth nothing necessary reference society fact God author speech man inventor shows get God say necessity common-wealth permit survival species requires kind communication man uses physiological resources produce invent language, speech want. The “author” necessary social dimension man’s life survival emerging several hundred thousand years ago. That’s could call “Law Nature” going see. God name glued I wonder opportunistic really believed. He modern uses language: register past present thoughts, findings acquisition arts (old meaning crafts artistic productions); communicate knowledge others; give orders instructions; pleasure. His conception speech centered “names”, “proper” “common universal.” And reduces (“wise” “foolish”) meaning words use, neglecting fact mind (what are, wise foolish) like language, developed experience, experience invention use language develops way process. For names designate things, material sensible rational, hot cold, moving quiet. Then indicate accidents qualities perceive things, concrete abstract. And done properties body. The eyes gives sight perceives color becomes idea fancy considered thing. The ears give hearing perceives sound becomes idea, fancy conception it, noise music. His approach interpretative genetic. The final use names, hence speech, meta-language describing language itself. As says names “general, universal, special equivocal” speeches “an affirmation, interrogation, commandment; narration; syllogism, sermon, oration many others.” Here “speech” means either utterance (sentence) discourse one several sentences. He even concludes names “inconstant” reflect moods states mind speaker. All modern, refuses frozen congealed language connected circumstantial use, though dialectic would state mind language develop together one other, one development mind causing one development language vice versa. The approach utilitarian: use language for. That’s consider abuses language one particular type use nothing else since basic abuses language say something lie, hence true, aggress insult people. If turn chapters 14 15 come “Laws Nature” fact central piece book. Let list comment. First defines “right nature” fact individual right anything needs order defend life. This survival instinct exclusively level individual. This important see fact species per se survival instinct human beings cannot survive species organize life collectively. In words misses concept survival instinct. Then define concept “liberty” “the absence external impediments” purely negative definition going show impediments natural, implying liberty, conclusion would absolutely refuse. He define concept “law” opposes “right.” A law gives obligation him, whereas right liberty him. It sounds weird since right also established society laws regulations. He misses history imposes onto people limitations opens people possible actions, hence duties (have do) rights (can may do). But said consider laws nature consideration nature implies organization man’s life. 1- The first law nature every man needs peace otherwise constant state war individual survival (one all). 2- The second law nature reciprocal limitation “the right things” ensure peace. This calls covenant religious reference behind though covenants purely human way divine. It simple observation human beings ALWAYS live groups various types even individuals live absolutely alone reference groups move away from. 3- The third law nature men perform covenants. He comes simple definition “just” (what respects covenants) “unjust” (what goes covenants). Justice keeping covenants, hence therefore rule reason. He states though must coercive power compel men equally perform covenants. That concept common-wealth appears. 4- The fourth law nature gratitude. 5- The fifth law nature natural accommodation complaisance. 6- The sixth law nature facility pardon. 7- The seventh law nature revenges man must respect future good. 8- The eighth law nature men’s contumely contempt one another. 9- The ninth law nature pride. 10- The tenth law nature arrogance. 11- The eleventh law nature equity, proceed equally dealing various men. 12- The twelfth law nature equal use things common all. 13- The thirteenth law nature “lot,” i.e. priority anything first possession possessor. 14- The fourteenth law nature Primogeniture first seizing. 15- The fifteenth law nature mediators. 16- The sixteenth law nature one’s submission arbitrament arbitrators. 17- The seventeenth law nature fact man judge 18- The eighteenth law nature No man judge cause partiality. 19- The nineteenth law nature witnesses supposed numerous possible. Hobbes adds twentieth law nature concluding remarks: 20- The twentieth law nature ""that every man bound Nature, much lieth, protect Warre, Authority, protected time Peace."" It strange states clearly existing authority cannot changed everyone supposed defend attacked. This full contradiction Puritan revolution attacked Authority King, though object represented authority Parliament attack King, Civil war necessary since supporters authority natural obligation fight it. What’s implies Puritan Common-wealth cannot changed people fight attempt done change it. Historically principle de facto unacceptable. The restoration took place later Glorious Revolution took place Jacobites declared illegal traitors. We point laws nature based individualistic considerations. They laws nature governing every individual social political facts consequences first principle. The second remark deeply anti-historical. If laws nature basic covenant human commonwealths, respecting implementing covenant basis justice finally “the laws justice eternal,” meaning laws devised application continuation twenty laws nature, essence covenant basis justice, possible historical change, absurd. He even goes declares “the science laws true moral philosophy.” Such laws science. They reasoning, hence best theory. True enough dealing ethics nothing else ethics cannot “true” depend many personal choices nothing truth, except true one particular moment one particular situation one particular person. And even one ethical elements instated basic human right, example right enter sex alliance, marriage not, one forced it: basic human right choose implement themselves. In words gay marriage becoming compulsory everyone considered today basic human right. Note way plain marriage type compulsory either though basic human right. Then discussion “liberty” reveals lot philosophy. 1- For liberty purely individualistic. 2- For liberty defined negatively: absence opposition, “not hindered do.” Note “he” pronoun also meaningful: consider women, consider blacks (who slaves colonies), Indians (who slaughtered already colonies) even Irish ruthlessly colonized) probably like Catholics, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus. 3- For based fear law incentive liberty, since liberty necessity consistent comes basic religious fundamentalism: man God wants man God want do, beyond two obligations (to do) man may covered included. 4- When dealing “liberty subjects” see contradiction “liberty” “subject” (someone subjected another, submits authority another), even asserts “the liberty sovereigns.” The important liberty asserts liberty man defend body body’s integrity. This Habeas Corpus principle passed Parliament 1679. For liberty subjects silence law. This asserts power Judicature. This premise become Montesquieu judicial power. But understand works: tried first level lower court. You appeal appeal court. You finally appeal “supreme court” (House Lords England, Supreme Court USA) decision edict total ban one activity, total freedom practice it, in-between regulated practice. The best example abortion US Supreme Court made history fifty states ruling attempt reduce right abort women Texas. (SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, Syllabus: WHOLE WOMAN’S HEALTH ET AL. v. HELLERSTEDT, COMMISSIONER, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES, ET AL, CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT No. 15–274, Argued March 2, 2016—Decided June 27, 2016. , accessed August 19, 2016) 5- He concludes book call leniency Censors since “there nothing whole Discourse, far I perceive, contrary either Word God, good Manners; disturbance Publique Tranquillity. Therefore I think may profitably printed, profitably taught Universities.” This book essential prove historicity concepts “liberty,” “common-wealth,” including I consider like “democracy,” “monarchy,” “aristocracy,” tyranny,” “oligarchy” direct political field.

We could add religion probably came belief supernatural higher level determinism soon Homo Sapiens developed language enabled start trip road conceptualization. We are, within Puritan Common-wealth, real round history. There several roads emerging front us choices free determined context. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",0.11,positive,
196,Fraser Kinnear,"Long, long, long, long, long. For such an important work of Political Philosophy, it would have been nice if Hobbes had applied some more economy in his writing. I could only get halfway through Leviathan, which I’m still proud of, as that still meant a 400 pages traversal.

As would be expected, some chapters are numbingly dull in their thoroughness (3 chapters devoted entirely to definitions of common words and phrases!!!) However, there are some that I really loved, such as:

Ch 13: Has the famous “…nasty, brutish, and short” line, but follows that with a fantastic point that basically goes “You don’t believe me? Why do you lock your door at night?”
Ch 14: Wherein Hobbes defines his “Law of Nature” that’s the core idea of this book. Our natures are to seek out our own individual liberties, which conflict with others’ liberties and create a “condition of Warre of every one against every one”. We must overcome our natures by following the first Law of Nature “” and the second Law of Nature to “”. Funny how many philosophers basically repackage the Golden Rule.
Ch 21: Wherein Hobbes defines and explains the scope of Liberty. He shows some proto-Libertarian ideas, specifically the scope of the law “As for other Lyberties, they depend on the silence of the Law. In cases where the Soveraign has prescribed no rule, there the Subject hath the liberty to do so, or forbeare, according to his own discretion.”

There’s some wonderful, albeit commonplace, lines about human nature. For example, this one on what we’d call today open-mindedness:

And despite being a Christian, there’s some interesting criticisms of religious behavior:


Hobbes’ means of organizing people and ensuring they give up some liberty is to form the “Leviathan” (which is a collective and not an individual) that has ultimate authority. Most of this is an exploration of the roles and constraints around such an entity. Sometimes, Hobbes espouses a sacrifice of rights that we would never accept today, for example freedom of speech:

Other chapters provide context for Hobbes’s biases. He survived the English Civil War in the mid-1600’s… I’m sure everyone was happy to sacrifice some freedom for peace.

Political philosophy aside, Hobbes is strangely prescient about some other ideas that were later embraced. For example, this line which seems to predict Analytical Philosophy: “Out of all which we may define, (that is to say determine,) what that is, which is meant by this word <, when wee reckon it amongst the Faculties of the mind. For REASON, in this sense, is nothing but (that is, Adding and Subtracting) of the Consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the and of our thoughts.”

Or these lines, which read very similar to some contemporary ways of explaining unbounded but finite universes: “When we say any thing is infinite, we signifie onely, that we are not able to conceive the ends, and bounds of the thing named; having no Conception of the thing, but of our own inability”

Or his many descriptions throughout of science, which probably should come as no surprise, as Hobbes worked for Francis Bacon in his youth.",False,,,774,37,3.0,,,en,"Long, long, long, long, long.

198,Padmanabha Reddy,"A long book, a lot of lessons, and wisdom about politics, this book contains almost everything that one would desire for. Written after the English Civil War that ripped the nation apart and published after the monarchy was restored in England, this book has been never out of a controversy. So much so that Hobbes was blamed for blasphemy and found guilty for the Great Fire of London in 1666. Hobbes was a fierce defender of the royalists and had to leave the country when Charles I was executed by the parliamentary forces after the English Civil war. Hobbes wrote another book titled Behemoth which is considered by scholars as to the best work on the English civil war where he analyzed all the causes and preventions to the civil war. The idea of naming his two greatest works “Behemoth” and “Leviathan” comes from the Book of Job from the Old testament. In many ways, the book Leviathan is considered as his greatest works for he laid the foundations for many more political philosophers like John Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau to give out their theories of governments and contracts.

The book is divided into four distinct parts. The first part “Of Man” revolves around human psychology and the natural human condition. Hobbes is a materialist who rejects the existence of angels as they aren’t looked upon in a materialistic manner. He also rejects what Descartes called the dualism which separates the body from the mind. The amount of effort put down by Hobbes to define every single aspect of human life and basic social elements like religion, quarrel, and good governance. He goes on to formulate the reason behind the origin of religion in the first place in which he tells that the natural inquisitiveness of humans and also our nature to believe in certain things to let go our tensions is the place where religion is born though he makes a distinction between Christianity which he calls as the true religion and the others which he calls as imaginary,
He gives out the concept of “The state of nature” which Locke and Rousseau used to create their works of treatises and social contracts. He tells in Leviathan that humans are not normally social people but they get together for personal gains like safety thus rejecting Aristotle's idea in his work Politics that humans are naturally social beings. In the state of nature, he describes that the only law is to self-preservation and thus no justice prevails and a person can go to any extent to save himself/herself. To get the society in order, people have to give out their liberty to a sovereign which Hobbes names as “Leviathan.” He explicitly also tells that the Leviathan is not a person but an office.

As the original cover to the document rightly contains a king holding a scepter and is filled with tiny people, Hobbes states that the sovereign gets his authority from the people thus rejecting the idea of the king being the divine representative of God. This brings us to the second part of his book where he talks about the Natural law and Laws of nature which gives us a whole set of rules which he justifies by citing only specific verses from the bible. The weirdest thing about Hobbes is he gives more importance to rights over duties.

He also lays down a set of rights for the sovereign who by the end of the reading we get to know is absolute. The idea of absolutism is very prevalent and strong in Hobbes. But he also lays a few limits for the powers of the sovereign which is again an interesting observation. One of those includes that he cannot harm his people and also can be removed from his office if he fails to do his duties.

The third part of the Leviathan “Of the Christian Commonwealth” contains the ideas and justifications for them which are laid down for the sovereign to rule in the borders of a Christian world. Hobbes becomes a bit radical over here and this is considered by scholars as one of the reasons behind the accusations on him by the Parliament. The last part “Kingdom of Darkness” is an extensive attack on Catholicism which the English who by the time were Protestants didn’t like at all.

For some Hobbes is a tyrant who gives all the power to a sovereign giving him a chance to become a tyrant. For others, he is one of the pro-democratic speakers who gave importance to rights more than duties.

199,jacob,"SURPRISE!!!! I woke up this morning and gave myself a cold hard look in the mirror, and forced myself to accept something that I've refused to accept for far too long - I don't wanna the rest of this fucking book. So I won't! I read 304 pages of Thomas Hobbes' Ye Olde English comsic sized political panic attack. I've done my God damn time. I don't care if reading his next 300 pages of Christian bullshit will further illuminate X or Y aspect of his philosophical system, and I choose today to happily live in ignorance. Frankly, I actually enjoyed reading the parts that I did and didn't really find his writing that much of a slog but it STILL broke me, so given that the half I've read is literally the only part that is directly applicable to my very specifically political interests, I've got better things to do and read. And even though I don't think there is literally ANYTHING in the 3rd and 4th sections of this book that could meaningfully change my rating of it, I suppose I should still specify more explicitly in case I one day return to this book to punish myself - this review ONLY pertains to sections 1 and 2.

Now, given the absolute abhorrent size of this book I can't go into anywhere near the specifics that I usually like to go into, so I'll just stick to the one ultimate pro and con that make this book a 3 star for me:

Pro - Political science is cool and based actually? I've often heard it said that this book started political science. I can understand why people say thay. Hobbes approaches the problem of politics from a fundamentally mechanistic and scientific perspective, beginning with a full account of human psychology, which builds into a theory of fundamental rights that then builds into a full picture of the body politic and it's proper role and function. Do I agree that politics should be fully and utterly beholden to facts about human psychology? No. Was Hobbes' theory of psychology itself dumb and not relevant in a modern context? Of course. But the methodology and it's incredibly thorough and comprehensive use in constructing a vast and all encompassing political philosophy is really something to marvel at. That's to say that despite it's flaws, the book ultimately operates from the vital starting principle that although politics maybe shouldn't be ENTIRELY beholden to psychology, it is nonetheless important to at least keep it in mind and have some basic metaphysical facts about humans down, so that one can craft a political system that is realistic within the context of human behavior. Of course this isn't a completely novel assertion, Plato did it way earlier. But the methodology in the Leviathan is much more rigorous, and the connections between the body politic and both human psychology methodologically, as well as human biology more analogously, are much more comprehensive and clear to the point that it doesn't feel like it's ripping off Plato's Republic, but taking a necessay step forward from it while still retaining its spirit.

Con - While Hobbes successfully retained positive aspects of Plato's spirit from the Republic, he accidentally retained Plato's bat shit insanity and hatred for democracy as well. Oopsie! The Achilles heel of the Leviathan and the literal heap of flawed prescriptions that result from it can really just be summed up as what happens when someone centers their crippling fear of political instability over literally any other possible moral obligation. And to be honest given the time period that Hobbes lived through, it's hard to blame him for this. Of course, that doesn't make his monarchy-boot kissing lips speak any more truth than they would otherwise. Given that he takes for granted right at the start of his process that having a functioning body politic AT ALL is always fundamentally better than not having one, it's easy to see how he goes so far off the rails. Combine that with an admittedly and surprisingly interesting theory of moral subjectivity, and you have your recipe for a political philosophy that justifies literally any abuse of state power so long as it can be argued such an abuse contributes to the stability of the state. Of course, one should always remember not to write off everything Hobbes says out of hand just because of this; once again following Plato, he somehow manages to pack a lot of wisdom into his heap of crazy talk.

200,Paul,"Wide-ranging, perceptive, and hard-nosed, this book seeks to establish the basis of the legitimacy of national governments, and to show why it is not only just that each of us should be under the absolute and arbitrary power of a sovereign, but that this is also necessary and good.

I came to this book not as one trained in philosophy or political science, but as one continuing to work out his own liberal education. So I had only the roughest idea of what Hobbes's philosophy was, or how he fit into the world of political philosophy. I knew him mainly as the author of the famous description of the condition of man in the ""state of nature"":

Well. I guess they don't call him ""Chuckles"" Hobbes for nothing.

The state of nature, for Hobbes, is a state of war of every man with every other man. Each looks to his own survival as best he can, and protects himself against the depredations of others as best he can. Everyone has an equal right to everything in the world that he, in his own opinion, thinks might help him in these aims, and if conflict arises between men for any reason, there is no final recourse except to violence. Each issue is resolved with the submission or death of the weaker party in the conflict. Then you hope for a bit of peace before your next conflict. In the state of nature there is no such thing as justice or injustice; there is only survival or death.

In this, it seemed to me, Hobbes was describing the behavior of animals, and in the state of nature he sees the human animal as no different from any other. What make the human animal different is his capacity for reason and language, which, together, enable him to understand his world better than other animals, and to enter into binding covenants with others of his kind. Our reason permits us to see that our peace and prosperity depend on people's willingness to refrain from molesting each other, but there is no way to realize this condition except that everyone involved make a mutual covenant to respect this rule. But the covenant alone is not enough; it must be enforced; and for this task the sovereignty of the group must be placed in the hands of one person, and everyone must agree to defer to him as a condition of belonging. And thus the state is born.

This is the ""social contract"" theory of the state, and, according to Wikipedia, Hobbes was the originator of this theory. This sovereign, who may be an assembly as well as an individual, actually personates the group: he embodies the power of the group. And this is the source of Hobbes's metaphorical title, for the commonwealth of individuals is compacted into the single great creature Leviathan, embodied in the sovereign. Whatever he does, he does by the will of the group, and this is by the explicit or implicit consent of each person in it. When he makes the rules, it is the making the rules; when he punishes miscreants, it is the doing the punishing. It boils down to this: no one can complain of anything the sovereign does, for everything the sovereign does is done with the prior consent of each subject. If I object, I am in effect objecting to my own will, which is an absurdity.

There are all kinds of problems with this idea, and I know that Mortimer Adler, among many other philosophers, rejected the social-contract theory outright. But Hobbes, no doubt conscious of the objections that could be raised against his idea, prepares his case with care and depth.

The first of the many surprises I got in reading this book was in discovering its structure when I opened the table of contents. The work is divided into four parts:

Of Man
Of Commonwealth
Of a Christian Commonwealth
Of The Kingdom of Darkness

I was surprised at the theological tone, and as I read the book I discovered that Hobbes was, among other things, a theologian, and that he had studied the Bible deeply, and drawn his own conclusions from it. These conclusions are key to his argument, for the question of the existence of God is all-important for the political philosopher as it is for any other kind of thinker. Hobbes believed that the existence of God was discoverable by human reason, but that the specific will of God was knowable only through revelation, which had been vouchsafed only to certain individuals, and then made generally known via the Bible. God's laws are divided into two classes: natural laws, which are discoverable by reason; and positive laws, which are encoded in the Bible. His natural laws apply to everyone, but his positive laws were given to his chosen people, the Israelites, when they accepted him as their sovereign at Mount Sinai. At that time every Israelite covenanted to accept the sovereignty of God, and thus bound himself to accept all of God's commandments; and this covenant is the type of the social contract. Thus God himself was the King of the Jews until they repudiated him at the time of Saul, when they demanded an earthly king of the same kind as other nations, and God acquiesced in their rejection of him. Then Saul became their sovereign, and the people were bound to him by the same kind of covenant they had made with God.

One of the important consequences of the existence of God for political philosophy is that it makes oaths binding. According to Hobbes, the oath of an atheist or heathen is worthless, because the atheist does not believe that he will be held to account by a supreme cosmic power. He will be tempted to renege if it suits him. The God-fearer, on the other hand, expects to face the consequences of his bad faith, even if no human catches him in it. It's an important point, because it is of oaths that covenants are made; and covenant is the indispensable basis of any commonwealth.

But this seems to be more of a practical matter than a theoretical one, for Hobbes holds that all covenants binding, even in the state of nature, and this is due to natural law. As far as I can understand and recall, Hobbes believes that our natural reason can perceive the logic of the covenant, and the necessity that it remain unbroken. But here I'm getting into an area that I find obscure and difficult. For Hobbes is emphatic that there is no such thing as justice or injustice until you have a commonwealth with a positive law given by its sovereign; then, any breaking of that law is an injustice. And anything else whatever is not. The principle by which covenants are to hold even in the state of nature is ""equity,"" which boils down to the Golden Rule. As far as I can make out, Hobbes is saying that if you break your covenant in the state of nature, you have violated equity, but you have not committed an injustice. To me this seems like a quibbling distinction, but to Hobbes it's a big deal.

Does this mean that the only valid commonwealth is a Christian commonwealth? Interestingly, no, it does not. For the validity of covenants being applicable in the state of nature, any commonwealth is equally valid as a civil entity. And Hobbes is at pains to show how God in the Old Testament, and Jesus in the New, enjoined us to obey our worldly masters. Both our natural reason and the Bible tell us we should render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. According to Hobbes, we each owe unswerving and even unquestioning allegiance to the civil power over us, whatsoever it may be.

This sticks in my gorge, and no doubt in that of almost every modern person. What would Hobbes have made of apartheid, or the Soviet Gulag, or other forms of entrenched, ""legal"" injustice? His view is that whatever the ""inconveniences"" of one's existing commonwealth, it is preferable to the condition of civil war, which is the inevitable result of a rip in the sovereignty of the state. For civil war is exactly the condition of divided sovereignty, and it inevitably produces great and undeserved suffering.

He may well have a point. Most of us enjoy the luxury of not having lived through a civil war--a luxury that Hobbes himself did not enjoy, since he was writing at the time of the English civil war, and lived in self-imposed exile for 11 years. As far as Hobbes is concerned, there will always be people who have complaints about the government; these complaints never constitute a reason to overthrow that government. The complainer is underestimating the benefit he continually draws from the state: namely, protection from his criminal neighbors, and protection from invading armies. Taking these protections for granted, he sets them at no value, but in this he is gravely mistaken.

is one of the most thought-provoking books I have read; my Great Books copy is now heavily highlighted. Hobbes, while a devout Christian, is also a realist with a modern and scientific outlook. His thinking is rigorous and uncompromising, and he takes great care to work his argument up from basic principles and definitions. As an intellectual achievement it has few peers. Part of my discomfort with the book is due to my sense that many of his assertions, while uncongenial or even distressing, may be difficult to refute. Certainly, if we believe that the universe has an absolute Sovereign, then we can hardly have any fundamental objection to the notion of absolute sovereignty; and Hobbes shows how in bowing to that sovereignty we are most surely following God's will.",True,4.0,97.0,,,4.0,,,en,"Wide-ranging, perceptive, hard-nosed, book seeks establish basis legitimacy national governments, show us absolute arbitrary power sovereign, also necessary good.

Everyone equal right everything world he, opinion, thinks might help aims, conflict arises men reason, final recourse except violence. Each issue resolved submission death weaker party conflict.

201,Eric Althoff,"This was supposed to be one of the great works of political philosophy in the English language, and yet all I could think of as I plowed through nearly 500 pages was ""when will it end?"" I have never been to law school, but doubtless Thomas Hobbes' 17th century tome would have been foisted upon me had I done so, if only as part and parcel of examining how English common law—and, its descendent, American jurisprudence—evolved into a coherent ethos of the state. All that came before is precedent, of course, but that certainly doesn't make for compelling reading.

Allow me to save you hours of reading by summing up Hobbes' philosophy: Human beings are selfish creatures who, if left unchecked, will steal their neighbors shit unless an overarching power—let's call it, ""the government""—is there to stop them. It's cynical even by the standards of a man writing during the heights of the English Civil War, but hey, the harshest truths are even the most stark.

There, I've just saved you the pain of reading ""Leviathan."" For though his axiom about selfishness is arguably the most famous passage on human nature in the English language, it is padded out by hundreds of pages of the parsing of religious dogma, particularly as Christianity and the Counter-reformation did their uneasy dance in the wake of Henry VIII, the founding of the Church of England and, however brief, the nascent English Republican, which perished almost as soon as it began in the wake of war between monarchists and republicans. Four centuries on, England—er, the United Kingdom—is what one might call a secular religious democracy, with the queen ostensibly the head of the Church and State but wielding no true power to speak of.

It was not so in Hobbes' day, when religion and politics were so linked, and one needs understand at least somewhat the English Civil War which, thankfully, the editor of the version of ""Leviathan"" I read, was blessedly willing to provide. For the backdrop against ""Leviathan"" was composed was as important as its author's theses. Indeed, looked at in the hindsight of nearly four centuries, it is amazing the Hobbes was not hanged for heresy, what with his suggestions that Heaven ""must"" be a part of Earth and not, as so much of Christian philosophy posits, a realm ""above"" and beyond.

In addition to poly-sci, I suppose ""Leviathan"" belongs in the syllabi of theological inquiry, but much of what he covers is beyond me—and not particularly interesting. Hobbes' bloviations on politics and religion could not help being intertwined given the geopolitical realities of his day, but for a modern reader, it doesn't precisely ring as relevant.

Thus I much, much, much preferred ""The Prince"" from Machiavelli, what with its warnings—still relevant today—against arming a lesser enemy and avoiding hiring mercenaries. Words that can be taken to heart in business, politics or religion. But it also stands that Machiavelli's writing continues to be compelling, whereas Hobbes'—perhaps due to his mastery of not only English but also Latin, Greek and French—feeling distant and even charmingly naive when read in the 21st century.

Like I said, don't expect to be blown away. And also like I said, know that his lesson that humans are selfish creatures who will seek to satisfy their appetites unless the power of the state—or tribe—nudges him otherwise can be summed up briskly. You don't need to read it all. The lessons are there, sure, but time is precious.

Rather, I leave you with some of Hobbes' best lessons...and I'll always appreciate, I suppose, that he leant his name to a certain cartoon tiger.


""But evil men under pretext that God can do anything, are so bold as to say any thing when it serves their turn, though they think it untrue; it is the part of a wise man, to believe them no further, than right reason makes that which they say, appear credible.""

""And therefore no man can infallibly know by natural reason, that another has had a supernatural revelation of God's will; but only a belief; every one (as the signs thereof shall appear greater, or lesser) a former or a weaker belief.""

Next he says without the state everyone is competing against each other: ""during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in a condition which is called war; and such a war as is of every man against every man"", obviously the anthropological evidence discredits this, and if they were literally at war archaeologists would find tons of mass graves yet they only find skeletons from interpersonal conflict. Constant war arises with the state.

Then he says people give away their rights to the state as a ""voluntary act"" and sign a ""contract"".

He thinks that ""the right of all sovereigns is derived originally from the consent of every one of those that are to be governed"" so he thinks peasants and slaves consent to their position.

He also believes that ""The subjects cannot change the form of government"" and that ""if he that attempteth to depose his sovereign be killed or punished by him for such an attempt, he is the author of his own punishment"". He then argues that ""No man can without injustice protest against the institution of the sovereign declared by the major part"", even if it was correct that ""the major part hath by consenting voices declared a sovereign"" (it's not) they still have the right to protest as the majority may be wrong and it is not just for them to be ""destroyed by the rest"" as he claims. Then he has the audacity to say that ""every subject is by this institution author of all the actions and judgements of the sovereign"" which is clearly false as we don't have direct democracy and claims the absurd notion that ""it can be no injury to any of his subjects"" and that they are infallible and ""nor ought he to be by any of them accused of injustice"". He also believes that they should never be held accountable ""Whatever the sovereign doth is unpunishable by the subject ... no man that hath sovereign power can justly be put to death, or otherwise in any manner by his subjects punished""

His belief that ""the end of this institution[the state] is the peace and defence of them all"" is ridiculous and his claim that ""whosoever has right to the end, has right to the means"" is nothing but justification of tyranny.

He declares his delusion when he states that ""in monarchy, the private interest is the same with the public"". Then he says non-state organisations should be banned: ""The leagues of subjects, because leagues are commonly made for mutual defence, are in a commonwealth, which is no more than a league of all the subjects together, for the most part unnecessary, and savour of unlawful design; are for that cause unlawful, and go commonly by the name of factions or conspiracies.""

He argues that government should not be changed or reformed: ""Subjects are to be taught not to affect change of government ... the prosperity of a people ... cometh ... from the obedience and concord of the subjects ... And they that go about by disobedience, to do no more than reform the commonwealth, shall find they do thereby destroy it"", nor even criticised: ""they ought to be informed how great a fault it is to speak evil of the sovereign representitive (whether one man, or an assembly of men); or to argue and dispute his power, or any way to use his name irreverently, whereby he may be brought into contempt with his people, and their obedience, in which the safety of the commonwealth consisteth, slackened""",False,,,55,,2.0,,,en,"The first 1/3 speculation human nature, followed small section state advocating tyranny, last half book useless ramblings Christianity.

And these are but a small part of the incongruities they are forced to, from their disputing philosophically, instead of admiring and adoring of the divine and incomprehensible Nature; whose attributes cannot signify what He is, but ought to signify our desire to honor Him with the best appellations we can think on. But they that venture to reason of His nature, from these attributes of honor, losing their understanding in the very first attempt, fall from one inconvenience into another, without end and without number; in the same manner as when a man ignorant of the ceremonies of court, coming into the presence of a greater person than he is used to speak to, and stumbling at his entrance, to save himself from falling, lets slip his cloak; to recover his cloak, lets fall his hat; and, with one disorder after another, discovers his astonishment and rusticity.'

""Absurdities in natural philosophy, as gravity the cause of heaviness""

'Then for physics, that is, the knowledge of the subordinate and secondary causes of natural events, they render none at all but empty words. If you desire to know why some kind of bodies sink naturally downwards toward the earth, and others go naturally from it, the Schools will tell you, out of Aristotle, that the bodies that sink downwards are heavy; and that this heaviness is it that causes them to descend. But if you ask what they mean by heaviness, they will define it to be an endeavor to go to the center of the earth: so that the cause why things sink downward is an endeavor to be below; which is as much as to say that bodies descend, or ascend, because they do. Or they will tell you the center of the earth is the place of rest and conservation for heavy things, and therefore they endeavor to be there: as if stones and metals had a desire, or could discern the place they would be at, as man does; or loved rest, as man does not; or that a piece of glass were less safe in the window than falling into the street.'

204,Stone,"While likely to attract an enormous amount of criticisms from modern readers, Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan was undoubtedly a remarkable milestone in the history of philosophy (and later political science). What Hobbes put forward in this book was essentially a reflection of a brand-new world marked by laws of mechanics discovered by Galileo and new fields of horizons discovered (you can dispute that, of course) by Columbus -- the static, lackluster medieval world suddenly came to a thrilling end. While new ideas from Rene Descartes and Francis Bacon began to move along the now dynamic earth, they were still slower in motion -- until Hobbes. The seemingly outrageous viewpoints (such as the state of nature as a ""war of every man against every man"", and the eternal need of a ""sovereign"") Hobbes desperately set forth in was indeed, quite revolutionary and groundbreaking in mid 17th century when the book was published. Note that because Hobbes believed that , he essentially challenged the authority of the Christian God -- which seemed to be one reason that he had to dedicated the entire Book III to a ""Christian Commonwealth"" in order to distract some attentions from the heretic inference one could easily derive from Book I. More importantly, while Hobbes was a royalist during the English Civil War and his work did seem to be in the Royalty's benefit, it nevertheless acknowledged the validity of overthrowing a Sovereign in favor of another -- though only to the best benefit of the collective people. As a result, it shouldn't be a surprise that this book was temporarily banned and was badly received by people from both ends of the philosophical spectrum, Hobbes seemed no more than a pig-headed reformist zealot to the academia.
Indeed, it is not only the conclusions of the book that were painful to comprehend, it was also the language itself. Hobbes was markedly a huge fan of Euclidean geometry and applied geometrical methods of proof to virtually everything in his book -- a practice unfound in any of the books of his contemporaries. While people with formal logic training may find ease reading these lengthy, geometry-styled inferences, most readers would rather emancipate themselves from such painfulness altogether.

205,Genni,"I would like to give this four stars, simply because I find it fascinating, but it honestly has too many glaring issues for that rating. However, I appreciate this so much more the second time around, especially after learning more about the English Civil War, which I think is necessary for understanding what Hobbes is against.

Most people are probably aware of Hobbes’ general ideas; that men are afraid for their lives, have a natural right to defend their lives, and the product of this suspicion and right is a state of war. In order to have peace, they create governments and he was an absolutist. Hobbes never defines peace, which is interesting since he argues from definitions throughout the book, but it is his deepest concern and it becomes apparent that what he means by it is an absence of war. I tend to think that people today would either define it more broadly, more positively, or would not prioritize it above other values to quite the point that Hobbes does.

Hobbes advocates for absolute surrender to government, and his preferred, most stable government would be a monarchy. He thinks people throw the term “tyranny” around too loosely and that they who do so just do not want to be governed. During the English Civil War, there were too many people who fought under different banners in the name of their religious conscious and, according to Hobbes, this was the cause of the chaos (which is true, but of course Charles I is not without fault). Socrates would have been the ideal subject in Hobbes’ kingdom. When Crito offered to break Socrates out of jail and he responds by saying that he who had not complained when things were going well for him could not now rebel when they pronounced against him.

However, he proposes that governments are built through individuals simultaneously and consciously surrendering to this contract, which is obviously not the case in almost any government, nor is it plausible to do so.

Hobbes is on firmer ground when he turns his attention to Christians and begins to argue surrender to government from Scripture. I do wish Christians in America would read this section and realize that some of what they are doing in the name of God is something entirely opposed to what Scripture teaches, but I digress.

Hobbes has some interesting arguments on martyrdom. He states that belief is a matter of the heart, and that Christians should not worry if their sovereign forces them to state that they do not believe. Consistent with the ontology and civic philosophy laid out in parts 1 and 2, he maintains that the responsibility in such a case falls on the sovereign, to whom the Christian subject has surrendered and therefore bears no guilt in this case.

This is just an introduction to Hobbes’ different theological turns. I read a phrase that I think describes his views perfectly: “unorthodox, but not unoriginal”. He maintains a sort of Christian materialism and views of hell that will strike the reader as modern. His views of man and nature are somewhat similar to those found in evolution.

In short, his relentless reasoning is dazzling, and consistent, but there is still much to argue with and ultimately, his state building is not practical in application at all.

206,Jason,"If you have a real passion for 17th century political theory this is the book for you. If you do not, you may as well just skip it.
Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan revolves around the themes of social contract, commonwealth, monarchy, and theocracy. The main thrust is that the goal of human survival is living a peaceful existence since life during wartime endangers people's safety, causing them to spend more effort on survival and less on leisure and education. Wars shorten people's lives so they must be prevented. The social contract means that citizens must give up some of their rights in exchange for the government protecting them from war. This social contract is called the ""commonwealth"" and a monarchical commonwealth is more effective than a democracy or aristocracy because the latter two cause politicians and their constituents to divide up into competing teams that conflict with each other. Hence the logical outcome is war and such wars can be prevented because an absolute, totalitarian monarch can not be divided against himself. The best monarch acts according to God's plans as they are laid out in the Bible.

The book is divided into four sections though I think it can be more usefully divided into two. The first two sections explain his theory of human nature, natural law, commonwealth and monarchy. It is essentially an anatomy of a corporatist political system. The last two sections are almost exclusively about theology, especially in how the Bible lends itself to theocratic and authoritarian monarchical rule. There is also a fair bit of vitriolic condemnation of Aristotle and the Pope. If you are not a Christian, and I am certainly not, this second half can be a tiring chore to read. If political theory is your main interest than skip it and quit at the end of the second section. Otherwise you will spend a lot of time reading some silly commentaries on whether Greek philosophers were agents of Satan, if the Pope is the antichrist, and why Catholics are similar to fairies and elves. I am not joking.

Leviathan needs to be understood in its historical context. It was written in response to the English Civil War. The Catholic church at that time was being chased out of England by the Anglicans in a conflict that was probably more political than theological. The English, at that time, were deeply questioning what form of government would suit England the best and Hobbes came down on the side of monarchy. This was radically progressive writing in those days but by modern standards this reads like a dystopian tome. That is why it probably is best to read it more as a historical document and reference point in the development of political history than as an explication of politics as we know them today. It just can not be judged by contemporary standards. It does help to know where the social contract originated since that idea is of importance in understanding the theoretical underpinnings of the US Constitution among other things.

207,Shaun,"A magnificent work of political theory and a significant touchstone of English philosophy. I found myself surprised at how quickly my previous assumptions about Leviathan faded away. Hobbes is not writing as a doomsayer of the human condition (at least not in my view) but as a man firmly grounded in his own experience during the English Civil War. His thoughts on humanity are tempered by his own knowledge of the world around him. Given how bloody the war proved to be, as well as the fact he was in exile while writing this book, who can blame Hobbes for recognizing a justifiably horrible part of humanity?

Certainly the first section is somewhat difficult to get through, as it requires careful attention to the chains Hobbes is constructing, but it pays off in the second section when Hobbes discusses the Common-wealth. Hobbes is insightful about certain aspects of the human condition, although I disagree with his argument that the essential state of human existence is conflict. Even as I disagree with him, I am drawn into the eloquence with which he presents his argument, and the clarity of his purpose. The third section is informative as well, although I feel more historically bound than the first two (mostly due to the particulars of how Hobbes configures a Christian commonwealth). I must admit that I skimmed the section on the Kingdom of Darkness, but plan to give it more attention when I turn back to this book. It is absolutely worth a read for anyone interested in political thought or philosophical inquiry. I think it is a master class is chains of logic, especially if you are willing to discount that Hobbes is starting from a somewhat unstable position of essentialism.

Overall, while I disagree with Hobbes' worldview, I think his philosophy is instructive in how to understand the role of the state and the social bonds and contracts we must necessarily form in order to maintain such an idea. I like reading this alongside some historical guides if you are not as familiar with the period, because it illuminates some of the more obscure passages and some of the methods of inquiry Hobbes undertakes. However, it does not seem essential to me. There is certainly enough material here to delve into without having to resort to documents of the rather messy Civil War, and the crises of ascension that follow it.

I don't necessarily recommend reading this work against Locke unless you are reading both very critically (not just in the sense of critical inquiry but also of of active dislike for the writings of either author). The narrative that has been constructed around these two works can inform perspective on how these books connect in a genealogy, but I find that flattens the works of both of these writers. The typical way I have seen them paired follows a logic of American exceptionalism, from Hobbes to a refined Locke to the perfected revolution.

208,Kurt,"Let me clear this up right away: I didn't read this expecting to agree with it, and even after finishing it, guess what? I still don't agree with it!

That being said, lest others accuse me of going into it with a closed mind, I did find it interesting as a historical document of the ideas it would be so influential in spreading, and I can't honestly say I disagree with absolutely everything in it - it's pretty funny, for example, to see that Hobbes basically advocates for communism-through-the-sovereign at one point when he argues that the sovereign should have the ability to redistribute wealth among the people in whichever way makes society run more efficiently/peacefully.

Something they don't tell you about reading Leviathan: approximately half the book is devoted to ""scriptural reasoning""-style arguments that nitpick over differing interpretations of biblical passages in order to prove that Catholicism's claim to supremacy over secular government is invalid. On the one hand, this is also kind of interesting as a whole from a historical point of view, and gave me a bit of a new appreciation for what Hobbes was doing at the time; if you haven't read the book, you might think his arguing that there should be no separation between church and state is a regressive one - but in fact he argued it in the name of progressivism, since he wanted to make sure that the church wouldn't have any kind of theocratic power within the state that could usurp the sovereign's rule. On the other hand, these arguments have little relevance to most people now unless you are an actual reactionary fascist Catholic supremacist; I'll admit part of the reason I was able to finish the book as quickly as I did is because I skimmed over most of these sections.

Anyway, a final note is in order here, just in case you think I'm painting Hobbes in too positive a light: this might be one of the worst PHILOSOPHY books I've ever read, in that the actual philosophy involved is sloppy at best (to the extent that the editors in my edition felt the need to add a bunch of footnotes pointing out every time Hobbes had contradicted himself or was straight up wrong about something). It's a clever sleight-of-hand trick to make broad, sweeping statements about an ""essential human nature"" in the first part of your book and then hand-waving away the concept of philosophically interrogating the ""essence"" of anything in the second by denying that metaphysics concerns a study of anything ""real"", but the result of this tomfoolery is that the legacy of political philosophy ever since has been trying to untangle this mess of assumptions that got us where we are now.

209,John Lucy,"Understanding the leviathan that is government is Hobbes's purpose here, and, in this edition at least, it will take some work, because all the original spelling is used. In a majority of cases it's clear what word Hobbes means, and you'll get used to it, but you will probably still find yourself reading more slowly than normally.

Other than that, Hobbes makes three points in this work: 1) most philosophers are stupid, because they don't properly define words or concepts, and therefore misunderstand everything; 2) people are naturally terrible, and the only way to escape a constant state of war is to enter into consent with others to be governed by a sovereign power; 3) once having entered into consent to be governed by a sovereign power, that sovereign power has all the power, and therefore monarchy is the best form of government. Point one is kind of funny to read when you notice it, and point two is recognizable as a form of the social contract that a number of philosophers use.

Something seems to go wrong, however, between points two and three. If a sovereign power has authority because of the consent of the people, how do the people, and individuals within the people, suddenly no longer have any power or input? The authority power, according to Hobbes, can never be overthrown or revolted against because the people gave their consent. Well, how did the people give their consent? Simply by being born? What if a person does not give their consent? Hobbes just plows over what seems entirely logical: that the people should still have some rights. His counter-argument is that the sovereign power would never act in such a way as to harm the people, but that's clearly ridiculous.

When Hobbes then takes his argument into the ecclesiastical realm, or the church realm, he has similar problems, except here he says that the head of the church can only be the sovereign head of civil government, and not a church figure, because 'the kingdom of God' is only spiritual, end-of-time reality and not in any way a present reality. That, of course, suggests that God and Christ have no power over life today, are not working in any way, except through the government. Put in this way, his argument contradicts a number of the scriptural passages that Hobbes relies on, particularly the passages in Samuel regarding the creation of the Israelite monarchy. God doesn't want to work through a government. Umm, okay, then, Hobbes, you're being dumb.

210,Ken Ryu,"Hobbes states his philosophy and provides his recommendations for the optimal political structure for countries in ""Leviathan"".

He begins with a breakdown of a human as a body with 5 senses to observe and navigate through life. He continues by describing the various emotions humans feel and how that impact our actions. He then expands his scope to describe how individuals function in groups, warfare and government to create societal structures.

He takes a closer look at governmental systems and classifies three major types: monarchy, aristocracy and democracy. His book was written during the mid-17 century when England was on the verge of a civil war. Opposition groups were challenging the monarchical rule and pushing for democratic rights and elections.

Hobbes fell squarely on the side of the monarchical system and goes on to describe the structure and advantages of this rule. In particular, he approves of the agility and cohesiveness of a single ruler model.

He then takes a massive digression into religion and especially Christianity. Interestingly he does not question a literal view of the bible and spends many chapters defending and interpreting the text. He tries to square religious doctrine with rule of law. In order of priority, he puts religious guidelines above government. He speaks much of the Roman Catholic faith and takes time to define the importance that a Christian nation follow the pope's lead and incorporates its legal and social structure to adhere to Christianity's rules.

He concludes the book by contrasting his philosophy from those of the Greeks and particularly Aristotle. He claims to offer a superior path as his is imbued with the teachings of the bible and Christianity.

The book takes large leaps as it moves from one major theme to the next. The biblical interpretations are self-serving and make for a divided work. The first half being mostly philosophy in the vein of Decartes and Aristotle, while the second half being biblical interpretations. He tries to please England, the Vatican and the Bible and his absolute faith in a strict biblical interpretation makes for arguments that lack important challenges to contradictory and embellishments of the bible that religious scholars and laymen struggle with. The book is dry, but has established its importance due to the strength of Hobbes intellect and his ambitious attempt to incorporate Christianity with philosophy.

211,Stephen,"This is a classic and foundational work of political philosophy, perhaps the first to cogently argue for the concept of a social contract that has become a staple of so much political philosophy ever since. The basic premise of the work is that people, by nature, find themselves in a state of war with one another unless they create some kind of commonwealth (monarchy or otherwise) which establishes an absolute sovereign.

I was aware of that background on reading the work, but I was surprised by it nevertheless. Firstly, for a work written during the English Civil War, this book was actually remarkably easy going. Yes there is is flowery 17th century expression, and archaic word endings ""he forgeteth"" and such like. Yet the author had a gift for expressing ideas in a manner that was not so dense that a modern reader would need help interpreting it. It was all very clearly argued.

I was also surprised by how much Christian theology was discussed and where Hobbes went with this. For a writer who was villified by other Christians (he was attacked as an ""atheist"" by Anglicans and French Catholics alike, and Jonathan Edwards, the Massachusetts Puritan spends much time pulling his arguments apart) he is actually able to reason some very interesting arguments from scripture.

On the one hand, whether angels are corporeal beings seems very much a medieval schoolman fascination of little modern relevance, but his views on transubstantiation and his reasoning about it are much more relevant to contemporary debate. Also his reasoning about authorship of books of the Old Testament would very much show up many engaged in the modern debate. So lots of fascinating stuff there.

Having said all that, I disagree with Hobbes on many things, and I felt that the treatise did very much reflect the context into which it was written, and there were some leaps and jumps of reasoning I would take exception to.

On the very basic question of the social contract: I find that the social contract has a gaping hole in it. Someone born into a political state cannot really be said to have assented to the social contract that places an absolute sovereign over them, if they cannot practically choose to dissent from it. Neither do I wholly agree about the state of war that would exist without such a sovereign. But then, this is a book review and not my own treatise, so I will end by saying that this is a fascinating book by someone who was evidently extremely clever, well read, and with great ability to communicate his ideas.

Having flicked through Descartes and Hume, and seeing them disagreeing with him at several turns too, I was interested to see what all the fuss was about. I was also surprised to see we have the same day job!

Obviously there’s a lot to disagree with in Hobbes’s thought, and a lot to be outraged about, but like other reviewers have pointed out, this alone doesn’t deserve a low rating, nor make a bad book - just a wrong one.

Hobbes is a methodical though sometimes laboured writer. His ideas are idiosyncratic, and can be better grasped with extracts or summaries you could find in shorter books. I wouldn’t recommend the whole book to interested readers, maybe just books one and two. (The third book was a bloated, 200-page discourse on the bible that I struggle to think why anyone but a Hobbes scholar would need to read - so don’t.)

If you’re going to pick up Leviathan, do it for a sense of the personality behind the ideas. His arguments for authoritarianism against democracy are hard to stomach, but I was interested to find they seem to come from a place of terror rather than cynicism. But he is no blind idiot either - there are traces of modern, progressive thought here, such as his hatred of inquisitions punishing people for their thoughts or beliefs, when people cannot help this. However his ideas have been cherry-picked elsewhere, it’s interesting to see the original mix, and the struggle behind them for peace and prosperity - even with his sometimes baffling conclusions.

It’s interesting to think that some of the most evil political ideas in circulation come from a well-meaning, sometimes droning, cautious, perhaps shivering man - who would pay any violent price, appease any monarch, to prevent the violent civil war he witnessed and fled from. Hobbes has the air of a wilting teacher, and reading him is like being stuck in the house of an old eccentric - you would leave with anecdotes of his strange ideas to tell friends, strange enough to make the experience memorable and stimulating - but you’d struggle to find space in your calendar to visit again. He’s naive and disconnected. He’s just another old racist. He’s something of an easy target as a result.

L'ultima parte, quella più lunga, è una approfondita e logorroica disamina sul perché la Chiesa e il Papa non possano considerarsi al di sopra dei regnanti: in sostanza, Hobbes afferma che tutti i passi della Bibbia danno agli apostoli un ruolo di consiglieri, ma non di governanti, poiché questo ruolo spetta ad altri.

Il Leviatano è un testo che mi ha sempre attirato, ma non avevo particolare voglia di leggerlo. Filosofia non è proprio il mio ambito. Eppure...
Hobbes si concentra sulla Politica e, in particolare, nello Stato. Divide quindi il suo testo in quattro sezioni: 1) Dell'Uomo, 2) Dello Stato, 3) Di uno Stato Cristiano e 4) Del Regno delle Tenebre.
Per quanto mi riguarda, ho trovato piuttosto interessanti la prima e la seconda parte, mentre il mio interesse è abbastanza crollato sulla terza parte.
In Dell'Uomo Hobbes si cimenta nella descrizione delle caratteristiche umana, come i sensi, l'immaginazione, la parola. Inoltre parla anche di ragione e scienza, come anche di religione, nonché delle altre caratteristiche umane come le passioni. In questa prima parte ci chiarisce le leggi di Natura e le cause del naturale conflitto che c'è tra uomo e uomo. Interessante, no?
Anche la seconda parte non delude: Hobbes ci parla di come si viene a creare uno Stato, di cosa porta gli uomini ad abbandonare le loro caratteristiche naturali che li portano al conflitto, aderendo ad un patto con altri uomini, il cui fine primo sono la pace (che sostituisce la guerra dell'uomo in natura) e la sicurezza. Ci parla quindi della figura del Sovrano e tutto ciò che riguarda lo Stato e i sudditi. Questa è la parte che più mi interessava, personalmente.
La terza parte, invece... Hobbes ci parla dello Stato Cristiano, e così facendo ci parla di Dio e tira fuori spezzoni dei testi sacri cristiani, che compongono la maggior parte di questa sezione. Mi sembrava di essere tornata a fare catechismo, che già mi annoiava da piccola, figuriamoci ora.
Nella quarta parte ci parla del nostro mondo corrente, che secondo lui è nel periodo del Regno delle Tenebre e, a continuare la sezione precedente, ci dice che il regno di Dio non è ancora venuto.

215,Mamluk Qayser,"This book's scope, like its title suggested is massive. It is one of those book which started from the minutest detail of the microcosmos, that is Man, to the apex of Man's reaches; in this book, the Common-Wealth.

Hobbes' main project in this book is to provide an all-reaching argument supporting obedience to authority according to human reasoning. As he grounded his argument in human reasoning, it is necessary and wise for him to start with the single unit-Man- and define Man's passion and his natural rights. This is what Hobbes' embarked on the Part I of this book, titled Of Man.

The second part, after he elaborated on human passion, he worked on to justify the formation of Sovereignty from the data he amassed in the former part. He argued that the natural right for Man is to protect or to preserve his life, and in Man's natural condition, the limits for self-preservation is almost close to none. So, Man in his primordial anarchic state, can enforce his basic rights with whatsoever means and impunity and thus, a perpetual Warring state. Only by the formation of an Authority can guarantee both Man's natural rights for Self-preservation and Peace. By assenting to the formation of an Authority, a Common-Wealth is created, a Leviathan, a macro-image of the microcosmos, which every of its subject's natural rights are guaranteed.

The third part elaborates on the formation of a Christian Common-Wealth. The fourth part was essentially an attack on what Hobbes' called as ""Vain Philosophy"" and the ""darkness"" it wrought. Being a Renaissance man himself, it is understandable why Hobbes and his peers developed degrees of ambivalence (to put it nicely) towards the Scholastic metaphysics.

I would categorise this book as a World-building book for the reasons I mentioned above. I can only recall few books that can rival Leviathan's scope, the closest one being the Muqaddimah of Ibnu Khaldun.

Instead, Hobbes is talking about the necessity of a sovereign government, particularly a monarchy.

is not well-known for much else, probably because there isn't much of a market among contemporary readers for the rest of the book.

So you get his argument that Jesus healing, but he couldn't have been casting out demons, because spiritual demons have no meaning (everything has be physical--even light comprises particles exerting pressure on the eyes). And according to him normally we wouldn't accept as true the kinds of things reported in the Bible, because as good empiricists we need to have extraordinary proofs for extraordinary claims, but: it turns out that we accept the Bible from the authority of the sovereign, the head of the church.

218,Kyle French,"I was taught, somewhere around high school, that Hobbes was the great balancing influence opposite Locke in the carefully constructed political philosophy of the US Constitution. Locke gives us the concept of inalienable human rights that are found in a state of nature, and Hobbes gives us a proper horror of the constant state of war that is found in a state of nature, where there is no authority figure to arbitrate the ways that the rights of one person may violate those of another.

In other words, according to Hobbes, we need the Leviathan. One supposes Hobbes was literate enough to understand that the leviathan in scripture was a sea monster commonly understood to represent the devil.

My expectations were a little bit unrealized. Reading the introduction, it became clear that the only people who loved this book were people who hate orthodox Christianity. That isn't an exaggeration. Hobbes set out to cast down the Reformational/Puritan scholastics that he hated from his experience at Oxford, and spent a good deal of time after he wrote the book attempting to prove that his philosophies didn't count as heresy.

So I expected to hate him, but I expected it to be awful in a way that was at least spectacular, and that's where I was disappointed. It turns out that the thing about Oxford that Hobbes apparently hated the most was Aristotle, and by all appearances, Leviathan was his best shot at overthrowing Aristotle - by being Aristotle.

Now I'm all about working things out from first principles, but Leviathan is a book of political theory - how governments are made legitimate, why we need government, how government can be effective. But Leviathan doesn't start with government. He starts with defining the difference between imagination and perception and the difference between dreams and fantasy. From there, where he was going, I'm not sure I could tell.

I can, however, give you a thumbnail sketch of his procedure, since he was kind enough to throw that out at the start. The basic idea he has is that men (meaning people) are by nature artists who create representational figures in their art. Government, or I should say society, is nothing more than a cooperative representation of a human being. Everything that a human being accomplishes in his own life, society accomplishes as a group - a man made up of men. Therefore, if we determine what exactly it is that a human being is and does - how he receives information about the world, how he adjusts to it and makes himself successful - we should be able to extrapolate that into what collections of human beings are and do, and how we coordinate as a society to understand our world collectively, adjust to it, and approach those peak points of culture.

Immediately, I was struck with two points which forced me completely out of engagement with the book. The first was that he assumes one of the key points in the current debate about individual liberty and government, which is that society and government are the same thing. If you make society and government identical with each other, then you rule out the possibility of tyranny from the get-go. If the problem with anarchy is that you've always got somebody trampling on his weaker neighbor, you can't solve it by insisting that both parties are part of a collective group, ruled by a careful administrator. It always turns out that the 'administrator' bears a striking resemblance to the trampl and the rest of the group bears a good deal more resemblance to the trample. Governments in society are only ever safe when there is an infinite regression of other parts of society that can come together with sufficient force to tell the government ""no!"" and really make it stick. If society government, then government is tyranny.

In case you weren't watching, tyranny is generally considered bad.

The other thing that kept sticking out to me is that Hobbes really hated Aristotle. Now, I've read a bit of Aristotle, and I really kind of like him. He really has a lot of sticking power. The renaissance and modern science made a pretense of overthrowing him for a long while, but all that is starting to look more like a 500 year fad. Aristotle says that when you drop a rock, it falls down instead of floating up because rocks have a natural resting place, such that, when you let it go, it is drawn to that resting place by its nature. Einstein tells us with mathematical clarity that it is nothing of the kind: It's just that bodies with enormous mass cause space to curve so that other objects with mass are drawn into them. Which is really another way of saying the exact same thing. What is mass, and the curvature of space, except ""nature""? The progress we've made in understanding the natural world, for the most part amounts to nothing more than better engineering and finer precision. The basic concepts are surprisingly consistent.

So also with Hobbes. He apparently hated Aristotle, or at least the approach of the scholastics of his day, who put a great deal of emphasis on Aristotle. But reading Hobbes, he sounds a great deal like Aristotle, proceeding by the same kinds of measures. But where Aristotle might have made an appeal to classical history, or to clear observations about the world that everybody was familiar with during his time, Hobbes frequently makes reference to science. Now Hobbes' science may have been quite good, maybe even groundbreaking in his day. I gathered from the introduction that many think he's an early modern precursor to dozens of modern fields of study. But the truth is, my poor background in modern science is a good deal clearer and cleaner than his thorough background in 16th century science. So even in the first chapter, Hobbes starts making observations about sense and perception based on the nature of dreams, and I'm rolling my eyes on two different levels (which is a very difficult thing to do), because not only is it clear that Hobbes doesn't know what he's talking about in terms of how the brain processes and analyses sense information, it's also pretty evident that part of what he's trying to do is prove he can be Aristotle too.

At some point in my reading, I just gave up. A book only has so many pages to hook my attention and convince me that it's worth my time to go on reading. Leviathan failed to do that. To mix metaphors from fields in which I have no experience, I felt my time would be better spent with someone who was spending less effort trying to knock every ball out of the park, and more trying to move the ball a few more yards toward the goal. He probably has some decent ideas in here, but it's just not worth the effort to go digging them out in the original.

219,Bard Ampora,"Leviathan is for some reason somewhat controversial for a lot of people, especially in modern times. As with all things in philosophy, there are points I disagree with, but there are also arguments that hold some truths and make compelling cases. It should be kept in mind that this was written while the church and state were still one. This was authored before Enlightenment and well before the separation of church and state. There's a reason that it was one of the most influential philosophical works of its time, and to this day it still is. This book brilliantly articulated the philosophy of political and natural science that he had been developing for years. His materialist philosophy was based upon a mechanistic view of the universe, holding that all phenomena were explainable purely in terms of matter and motion, and rejecting concepts such as incorporeal spirits or disembodied souls. Hobbes's Leviathan also challenged the very basis of philosophical and political knowledge. It attempted to create controversy in not just philosophy, but in politics and in science. Despite that, it sought ultimately to annihilate controversy for good . Hobbes's philosophical method claimed to provide indisputable conclusions, and its depiction of the Leviathan of society suggested that this method could put an end to controversy, war, and fear.

If you're thinking of picking this up, then do so. It may be hard to get through (it is a beast of a book), but once you form a general understanding about what he's trying to say, it could be enlightening.

220,Caris,"I didn’t consider this rating lightly; this is the worst review I’ve given to a classic philosophical work. There are a number of reasons for this: two stars would be a book I disagree with and didn’t enjoy, but can still appreciate its influence and/or arguments. This book didn’t even deliver that. It has contentious and blatantly wrong assertions, with either little or flawed argumentation.

Furthermore, despite its reputation and influence, there was nothing radical about Christian theocracy in the 1600’s. Where Hobbes is correct, he is just parroting Plato, Aristotle, or Aquinas. Where he is wrong, he isn’t proposing anything new. A view that I disagree with, but could entertain, would be Hobbes’ appeals to Human Nature. But like most classic, bourgeois philosophers, Hobbes mistakes ‘human nature’ for struggles borne of contemporary material conditions.

On the other hand, a view that I disagree with for its utter lack of intellectual rigour is Hobbes’ argument for a “prime mover”, taken for granted straight from centuries of Christian tradition. His discomfort with an infinite regress of causes leads him not only to conclude that there must be a first cause, but that such a cause must be ‘god’ and contain, conveniently, all the qualities of the Christian god. He provides no argument and no demonstration of necessity for this. His political ideas derive from vapid and lazy assumptions.

221,Gina,"One reason I read this is because so many political philosophers find agency and individuality to be great harms, and I heard that was not the case with Hobbes, but that may be from another work. Its not that his system set up everyone being alike or having their roles strictly defined -- it just didn't come up.

Instead, it is mainly about the logic of being subject to kings. While it would be easy to disagree, I cannot separate his conclusion from his time period, where England had deposed their king and gone through Cromwell as Lord Protector, and then restored the monarchy. Hobbes himself was close to Charles II; what else would make sense to him?

The other thing that surprised me was that it appears that accusations of atheism were a real danger for Hobbes, and yet the book is based so much on scripture and assumes the being of God as self-evident. I can only assume it is because he applies critical thought to how we think about religion, which could have seemed dangerous. The conclusion ends up being that it is correct to follow a king, even if he is in error. It is pretty critical of Catholicism, likening it to superstitious beliefs in fairies and ghosts, but that should have been pretty safe in England.

As much as I can disagree with various conclusions, I have to be impressed with how clearly and deeply he thinks about everything.

Ironically, not only his views got him in trouble with the Parliamentarians (before publishing the book) so that he had to flee and stay in France prior and during the English Civil War (1642–1651), after he published this book it has been received quite coldly by (who became to be) Charles the Second, even if to my mind and understanding this book is fully supportive of the latter's right to rule (which only comes to show that most kings are complete idiots).

What I did not particularly enjoy was the long and arduous legalese-like treatment of rights, duties, punishments etc; I also did not find his treatment of God's laws and role in the last chapter to be genuine, but more of a lip service so as to detract of those blaming him of being an Atheist (which I reckon he was.)

""Leviathan"" by Thomas Hobbes from 1651 is by far a complex, controversial book that to this day is one of the most important Western philosophies in relation to politics. I liked the reference to the sea monster from the biblical reference, before whose omnipotence all human resistance fails - a fascinating metaphor for the state and the human being in the state structure. it makes sense for a philosopher of the 17th century, the son of a country pastor, to work so closely to religion and to combine his understanding of the state structure with it. the state that Hobbes creates for man, only in the natural state far from law and state, releases the almost anarchist thinking, how man would probably act, where would be good and bad and what would be motives? Hobbes concludes quite logically that man's instinct for self-preservation is a natural state, so that he is not bad, only interested in survival. and that can definitely be approved. many confused readers like to classify it with social darwinist ideologies, but i think that is the inadequate conclusion which people use philosophy or instrumentalize science and use it to establish a kind of social darwinism.

Why would humans adhere to such a covenant (not a social contract, as other late philosophers such as Rousseau or Locke would say) if the state rules by using fear and a multitude of restrictions to the natural freedom of the people? As Hobbes would say, it's because the natural state of the humankind is way scarier: the state of anarchy, in which a war of ""every man against every man"" ensures a painful, brutish and short life.

Hobbes活了92岁经历了17世纪英国动荡的政权，作为一个政治学家也是挺牛的。The grand conclusion of Hobbes’s analysis of human nature is that men are necessarily engaged in an incessant struggle for power over others (about man’s necessarily competitive search for power).Hobbes认为人对死亡的恐惧是不言自明的。“Every man…shuns what is evil, but chiefly the chiefest of natural evils, which is death; and this he doth, by a certain impulsion of nature, no less than that whereby a stone moves downwards.”
Hobbes提出的主权社会其实本质上是资本主义社会，虽然他认为内战的罪魁祸首是新兴的资产阶级，而他的理想主权国家的最终目的是避免内战。Macpherson认为Hobbes对平等的执念阻止了他认清阶层分化和资产阶级作为一个阶层凝聚力的必然性。Hobbes认为个体对权利的竞争本性使得他们愿意诚服于主权社会/政府，从而获得对个人财产和安全的保护。

三百多年前的英语读起来比想象的容易一些，很多词拼法不同但很好猜，有些稍微难点，但多读几遍也猜出来了。比如Trayne for train，perswasion for persuasion. 当然也有些要查字典才知道啥意思（比如hearkened，devest）。后来听了另一本书才知道16世纪的英语已经是modern English了(from 400s through 1066 Old English, 1066 to 1400s Middle English, 1400s onwards Modern English).

总体来说很枯燥，很多定义啥的（关于法律，联邦，基督教联邦，基督教教义等等）。本书在历史上的重要性并非仅仅源于结论（反对君权神授，主张专制主权国家）而是方法（首次把政治提升到科学的高度，从个体推论到政权）。

“Adherence to Custome, from ignorance of the nature of Right and Wrong…Which is the cause, that the doctrine of Right and Wrong, is perpetually disputed, both by the Pen and the Sword: whereas the doctrines of Lines, and Figures, is not so; because men care not, in that subject what be truth, as a thing that crosses no mans ambition, profit, or lust.”",False,,,143,,4.0,,,en,"Thomas Hobbes, Power Peace using scientific method (political science).

230,Elisa,"This is a breakthrough masterpiece in the political philosophy arena, but reading it through and through is as much fun as reading an encyclopedia the same way. It's easy to appreciate the amount and scope and far-reaching depth of this work, as well as the genius in the man who wrote it.

Hobbes wasn't the greatest democrat or liberal (to put it mildly), but his ideas on the sociopolitical nature and needs of humans are as accurate as anyone with a cynical (realistic?) view has ever set forth. Hobbes's basic tenet is: without rules and a sovereign power (whether it be monarchical or democratic) to enforce those rules, we would all be running around chopping heads off. If history has taught us anything, Hobbes is just telling it like it is and always has been. Of course, he goes to extremes in the sovereign ass-kissing department, but he was also a man of his time.

The second part of Leviathan deals with religion, and he eviscerates the Church and the Pope. It's his entertaining bit and he even adds a little humor here and there. Among other things that surprised me, he thought pretending to eat the body and blood of Christ is ridiculous, that the soul is inseparable from the body, and that there are no such things as heaven or hell, let alone purgatory.

For Hobbes, civil power is supreme, and the power of a king is not derived so much from his power, but from the obedience that his people show him. Hard to argue with that. A bright man, Hobbes, and one I'm glad I can appreciate even if I don't agree with everything he wrote.",False,,,445,56,3.0,,,en,"This breakthrough masterpiece political philosophy arena, reading much fun reading encyclopedia way.

231,Timo,"Read as part of my revisiting historical philosophy...

I'm not always sure what to make of Hobbes. There are times when I feel like he was playing all sides. Atheist? Not atheist? Royalist? Not royalist? He was certainly embroiled in the middle of the discussions of his community at the time.

And maybe this is how we should view Hobbes. He was a determinist (though a soft-determinist), meaning he disbelieved in free will. And maybe as such he himself was acknowledging that his own views were mere products of the time and the place in which he lived.

Though I think he arrives at his Social Contract theory a tad dishonestly, I don't exactly believe that he was saying, as is commonly said, that all life is ""solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short."" I think he was dramatizing the potential of a life outside the protection of community. And in certain ways, even if not wholly accurate from an historical perspective, I think there's something to be said about the foundational needs of community to ground one's life.

But in the end, I think that Hobbes tried to be too cute, to dance too much within the controversies of his time. And that makes his value to now less than it might be. I have no faith in the foundational principles of his ideas, and thus mostly view him as important in history, but not that important in philosophy.",False,,,103,4,3.0,,,en,"Read part revisiting historical philosophy...

Hobbes intention is twofold, firstly to prove that it's everyone's duty to obey whoever is in power, and secondly how nasty the Pope and the catholic church is.

The second part is better than the first. The problem with Hobbe's philosophy is that he puts the cart in front of the horse. Instead of starting with definitions and then exploring logically what can be deduced from these definitions, he instead starts with the position that ""you should always obey your sovereign"" and works backwards to prove why this is so.

I'm not going to waste time or energy in refuting Hobbes, other have done that more eloquently than I will ever be able to, but it's obvious that this text was mostly written to promote his own standing and curry favour with those he sought employment from.

If nothing else it gives a brilliant insight in the kind of intellectual discourse that was going on in his time, and how deeply flawed it was.

234,Omar Delawar,"The notions of civil society and the rule of law are relatively new. In previous eras, farmers armed themselves to protect their lands; robbery seemed a logical solution to the misery of poverty.

English philosopher Thomas Hobbes took a hard look at his seventeenth-century world and found to his dismay that suffering was the rule of the day and that something needed to change.

To bring order to societal chaos, Hobbes created his “leviathan,” the model for a strong, centralized power (basically a Monarch) that based on the support of the people, could create a society in which peace could flourish.

While reading this, I couldn't shake off the notion that Hobbes was paid by the Monarch to write this. While his ideas on the ""social contract"" were sound, the need to put a Monarch at the helm of society and give him/her all the power makes this whole text super suspect. I would still recommend reading this as a historical record but not as a serious work on political philosophy it is sometimes claimed to be. It's way too suspect for that.",False,,,134,24,2.0,,,en,"The notions civil society rule law relatively new.

His idea: to be inspired by the discoveries of Galileo, imagine a society no longer populated by organic communities, but by individuals behaving like atoms isolated from each other.
To this end, he makes two decisive statements.

First affirmation: we are all free, equal in our faculties and rational.
This is why - this is the second statement - ""Man is a wolf for Man"".
In the state of nature, in fact, since we are free, equal and rational, we find ourselves in competition to appropriate the best resources. How then to escape the war of all against all?

Man according to Hobbes understands that, to live in peace, he must give up his natural freedom to enter the city. There, his security will be assured, and he will be able to go about his business by making and protecting himself by contracts - always reversible - with his peers.

This is the new social pact proposed by Hobbes and which will become the matrix of our modern imagination.

As the book progresses so do the concepts which he ties in, all pertaining to a civilized society and the maintenance thereof.

To put it simply, there may be some oversimplification involved in how his idea of a lawful society should function would have to function in practice.

238,Jekaterina,"I used to think that in those times, Kings were believed to be appointed by God because God allowed them to be born into the ruling family, and created the circumstances where they could come to power. Not so. Hobbes looks at the history and writings, including the Catholic Church, to show that it was the Church that ruled all Christians and therefore selected legitimate rulers. The Church argued that after Christ’s Ressurection, we live in the Kingdom of God and they are his Ministers. As Moses, for example, was the ruler of his people both in Spiritual and Civil capacities, so the Church was above Kings. As the Church was supremely able to interpret Scriptures and the Will of God, so they could withhold the blessing from Kings to rule, declare his descendants illegitimate, wage wars, appeal directly to his people to revolt, etc.

Hobbes lists how certain rules of the Church are contrary to the Scriptures and were invented to entrench the power of the Church. I find it most fascinating that the reason Priests cannot marry, is to ensure that a King cannot profess to head the Church unless he renounced the inheritance of the Kingdom by his children.",False,,,37,4,,,,en,"I used think times, Kings believed appointed God God allowed born ruling family, created circumstances could come power.

In this volume, Hobbes explores human nature to a natural conclusion, life is nasty, brutish, and short.

The book proper is composed of four main sections; Of Man, Of Commonwealth, Of A Christian Commonwealth, and Of The Kingdom of Darkness.

I read this during covid and the many discussions around obedience to authority we were having then, so despite it's age this felt like a relavent book.

The idea that you must have pretty much absolute authority in order to escapte the ""state of war"" is made a little bit too absolute by Hobbes. I think there needs to be more nuance around choosing between unquestioning obedience to authority and every man for himself. Those aren't the only two options and this books tends toward arguing as if they are.

It was a good read though in terms of thinking through some of the foundationali ideas of political sciences, and gave me things to chew on as I thought things through during the times in which we live.",False,,,205,,3.0,,,en,"I try read books stretch mind bit.

It is a pillar of his thought which he repeats in many different contexts and can hardly be taken seriously. One example:

""But by this Institution of a Common-wealth, every particular man is Author of all the Soveraigne doth; and consequently he that complaineth of injury from his Soveraigne, complaineth of that whereof he himselfe is Author; and therefore ought not to accuse any man but himselfe; no nor himselfe of injury; because to do injury to ones selfe, is impossible.""

is an excellent place to begin studying political philosophy and the origins of modern political systems. Written in a time of great political turmoil (the English Civil War), Hobbes sought to defend the monarchy by presenting the most compelling argument possible for the rule of kings.

Hobbes' major contribution to the world of political philosophy is the concept of ""social contract,” the idea that citizens agree to give up a little bit of their freedom in order to create a state that works for the benefit of all. Individuals (who are naturally self-interested, according to Hobbes) agree to submit to a civil authority because the natural state of man has:

In other words, the social contract makes possible a peaceful coexistence and all the fruits of civil society including the sciences, arts, and letters. Hobbes' writing serves as a wonderful testament to the power of order and thoroughness in philosophical writing, and it calls on the reader to consider their own relationship to being governed and to government in general.

This classic Penguin edition is based on the original 1651 text; it incorporates Hobbes' own corrections while also retaining the original spelling and punctuation and it reads with great vividness and clarity. C.B Macpherson's introduction elucidates for the general reader one of the most fascinating works of modern philosophy.

Readers interested in the roots of modern political philosophy should also read Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s own . Rousseau’s work begins from the assumption that man is cooperative by nature (rather than naturally selfish, as Hobbes assumes), and goes on to tell a very different story about the founding of the modern political state. This text should also be read alongside Plato’s , the founding text in political philosophy.

Those interested in philosophy of literature and film can read and watch The , Nobel Prize winning William Golding’s 1954 chilling rendition of Hobbes’ political philosophy.

Quotes:

“The natural cause of religion is the anxiety of the time to come…all men so much as to be curious in the search of the causes of their own good and evil fortune…thinking that anything that has a beginning also had a cause…when he cannot assure himself of the true causes of things (for the causes of good an evil fortune for the most part are invisible) he supposes causes of them.” 63 – What Hobbes is saying here is that things just happen, yet most people will search for a greater cause. The role of religion is to create the notion of a greater cause and its purpose is control of behavior through fear.
The gods were first created by human fear. 64
Men have no pleasure, but on the contrary a great deal of grief, in keeping company where there is no power able to over-awe them all. 75
“Men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in the condition which is called war…every man against every man….In such conditions there is no place for industry, because the fruit is uncertain, and consequently, no culture of the earth, no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea, no commodious building…no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.” – A harsh perspective. Basically, life is short and pathetic, men must be kept in a state of awe by something more powerful than themselves. War is an instrument for keeping them yours. Yikes. 76
“To this war of every man against every man, this also is consequent: that nothing can be unjust. The notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice, have no place. Where there is no common power, there is no law; where there is no law, no injustice.” 78 Essentially, the ideas of justice and rights are first off, just ideas, and secondly, predicated on having a common power to keep people in check. It is important to have that power, rights are a silly notion that rests the foundation of power through fear.
“The mutual transferring of right is that which men call contract…words alone, if they be of the time to come, and contain a bare promise, are an insufficient sign of a free gift, and therefore not obligatory.” 83 The idea here is that by living in a society in which the government has ensured your peace and liberty (which Hobbs defines as the ability to move molecules in your brain, haha!) you have given over some of your rights. When you are born you enter into a social contract (not sure if he was the first political philosopher dude to conceive of this idea, but he was one of the first).
“The only way to erect such a common power as may be able to defend them from the invasion of foreigners and the injuries of one another, and thereby to secure them…reduce all their wills, by pluarity of voices, to one will…to submit their wills, everyone one to his will, and their judgments to his judgment. This is more than consent, or concord; it is a real unity of all of them…This done, the multitude so united in one person called a Commonwealth, in Latin Civitas. This is the generation of the great Leviathan, or rather (to speak more reventely) of that Moral God to which we owe, under the Immortal God, our pace and defense.” 109 Basically, the Leviathan speaks for and protects every man, and we should submit to it like a god. It is better to be a unified protected whole because otherwise we’d kill each other.
“Laws of nature…are no properly laws, but qualities that dispose men to peace and obedience…In the differences of private men, to declare what is equity, what is justice, and what is moral virtue, and to make them binding, there is need of the ordinances of sovereign power, and punishments to be ordained for such as shall break them, which ordinances are therefore part of the civil law.” 174 OK, laws are only meaningful if backed up by the power of force. Notice too that laws of nature only dispose men to peace and obedience, by themselves they are insufficient, we are still violent creatures. He then gets into a rather long defense of why force is necessary and how best to apply it.
“For seeing the ghostly power [Hobbes’ term for religion] challenge the right to declare what is sin…the civil power challenging to declare what is law, every subject must obey two masters, who both will have their commands be observed as law, which is impossible…When these two powers oppose one another, the commonwealth cannot but be in great danger of civil war and dissolution. For the civil authority being more visible…cannot choose but draw to it in all times a very considerable part of the people.” 216 If religion is a separate realm, it’s another power player and that is not in the best interest of the commonwealth. Rather, an effective government will incorporate a religious realm.",False,,,437,71,4.0,,,en,"A haunting look government control human mind. It worth challenge bash heads Hobbes, smart man indeed.

291,Hank,"Who am I to give such a classic only two stars?

What I really mean by this rating is that while I'm personally glad I listened to the book, I can't wholeheartedly recommend that anyone else invest the necessary time.

The main reason being that a very large proportion of the book is dedicated to debate of what are now relatively esoteric disputes regarding interpretation of the bible, which I think are likely relevant to a very small proportion of the population these days and given major changes in societal norms since this was written are rendered even less relevant.

Overall, I think Hobbes was primarily attempting to document how the world works and lay out the best philosophy for an individual to contribute positively to society as a whole at the time. From which motive, I think he did an OK job of describing human nature and advocating for support of the existing societal structure (regardless of what it might be) vs dedicating one's life to the trendier (not sure if this was true in those days) goal of ""change"" or worst yet subversion. On the other hand, Locke definitely hit the nail closer to the head with regards to first principles of human nature a bit later on down the road.

Certainly some observational gems here and there in the earlier portion of the book most notably that entitled ""On Error and Absurdity."" So best strategy may be to soak up the first bit and drop the book when focus shifts to biblical interpretation, unless that is of particular interest to you.",False,,,172,,2.0,,,en,"Who I give classic two stars?

It is also hard to see Hobbes's perspective: he just wanted peace and would sacrifice anything to get it. He would have read 1984 and rooted for Big Brother (were it not for the forever-war on the borders) because chaos = bad. This book really is a work of political genius and historically important beyond compare, but the writing is, well... it's bad. This book really could have been 100 pages, but Hobbes thought he was making a religion so he had to write a bible.

469,1.1,"Finally I get to read the Handbook of Absolutism. My first thought being, as I will now state, that indeed to my modern ears, the writing therof was considerably archaic and, it might be added, in due course also pompous. Yet, that leads to lots of fun sentences wherein one can find such stunning multiplicity of commas, and subordinate clauses, that to go on reading, and even to keep one's eyes focused, and also one's eyelids open, doth feel a chore. It also leads to that fun kind of philosophical construction that maketh one chuckle:



Judge much, revered Hobbes? Imagine reading that after 30+ dense pages of discussion on jurisprudence and judicature and judgment. While I was reading, sometimes the meaning went out of words, and only reconnected with them after some pages or a bit of rest for my eyes. To get it out of the way: I don't recommend this book to most people at all, but scholars (who should read it), philosophers (do they still exist? if so they should read this that I might delight in their learning or frustration), and hidebound pedants (which, truth told, are the former two in one body, a commonwealth of sorts).

That said I did enjoy Hobbes' reasonings and it would be churlish not to admit that he wrote this piece painstakingly, taking care to explain everything for the reader, and the parts we can't understand due to our remoteness from his time, can be chalked up to the effects of the English Civil War or anxieties he had relating to that. In addition, while reading I was hoping that the final part, 'Of the Kingdom of Darkness', would be my treat, but to get it I had to go through the most tedious part of, I think, any book I've ever read: ""Of a Christian Commonwealth"" (and, in perspective to it: my abandonment of now seems especially weak). But then I got treated to some spectacularly reasoned raillery against the Papal Church and, finally, I smiled a little, imagining this Hobbes dude just sweating in the French summer heat and scribbling away a storm amidst a pile of books, going after the one thing he hates more than pagan tradition, and disdains more than women: the Church of Rome... delightful.

I picked a bad time to read this book. Due to generally being busy, it took about 5 weeks to get to half way into the second part, but I resolved to read the rest in a week and just managed to do it, mostly by forcing myself to go on and by taking the utmost pleasure in passages that were well-constructed, forceful, or interesting. There's a lot to learn in this book, about the now-outdated ideal of Commonwealth and also about the fine line political writers had to tread in the 17th century.

Is it archaic? Yes. Rightly important? Well, sure. It's definitely part of the canon of western civilisation. It's tedious though. It's the source of 1 quote, literally just 1 quote, that's often trotted out. No wonder. I suspect the vast majority of people who speak of the Hobbesian state of nature haven't read this whole book, because they'd still be struggling to finish it. Still, nature vs civl and all that... very good. Lots of reason, and things following by reason, in this book: so if you like that, have at it. You'll get a real kick out of this man's style.

Ultimately what this book really got me to think about was individualism versus collectivism. In our era we wouldn't sacrifice an iota of personal liberty to save our state, or even in many cases to help a homeless person, or to learn something, or to improve ourselves; our governments are mostly filled with people who are so detached, checked-out, exploited (or exploiting, beyond civil servants), untrustworthy, and venal that to give ourselves willingly to them, as in Hobbes' ideal state of individual and commonwealth, would be totally irrational. It would be interesting if Hobbes were resurrected and rewrote this book for our era, after, say, 10 years of intense study of it, to see how it would be changed from the 17th century.

One major benefit of reading this book is that, for a few weeks at least, basically everything will seem like extremely light and pleasant fare (my return to fiction and biography will be glorious). Sometimes, to be honest: I barely enjoyed reading this book, but please note: I did not pun on its name at all in this review.

477,Peter Crouse,"The mid-17th century was a tumultuous time for Europe. England and Germany were both recovering from violent civil wars; France had barely withstood a rebellion by the disgruntled nobility; the once mighty Spanish Empire was sinking into decay; and the Turks would soon be pounding on the gates of Vienna. Out of these murky depths emerged Hobbes’s Leviathan, a political treatise which advocates the absolute authority of sovereignty as the only effective means to withstand the all-too-familiar evils of civil strife.

Man, according to Hobbes, is fundamentally motivated by selfish material desires that continually place him in a state of discord with his fellow human beings; a state which, in the infamous phrase, renders his life “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short”. To lift us out of this condition of perpetual fear, we have constructed natural laws that constrain us, by mutual agreement, to live in peace with one another and give rise to the all-powerful sovereign who alone possesses the authority to legislate, arbitrate and indoctrinate for the good of society. Hobbes recognizes that this power can be vested by either an individual or an assembly; but, like Plato, he prefers absolute monarchy over democracy, which he believes to be nothing but a nest of divided opinion and deceiving oratory. Whatever the case, in Hobbes’s society the subject has one predominant virtue: obedience.

I can’t deny that one of the main benefits of the state is to provide peace and security to its citizens. Hobbes was horrified by the blood-letting of England’s recent Puritan Revolution and he constructed his system in hopes of avoiding a return to the savage condition of man-against-man. But to say that the primary function of the state is to serve as a bulwark against chaos is to proceed from a thoroughly negative, manichean interpretation and creates far more evils than it seeks to avoid. What happens if the sovereign is unjust? While Hobbes admits the possibility, he believes that it is better to obey in silence rather than to permit dissent and risk the dissolution of the commonwealth. This is what is so repugnant about Hobbesianism: it elevates the sovereign above the law; it provides man with freedom of thought without giving him freedom of action; it declares that it is better for man to kneel beneath the rod and submit to the lash, rather than realize the dictates of his own conscience. Where is the spirit of Humanism? Where is Aristotle’s conception that man is naturally a political animal? Strangely, Hobbes denies his ruler authority based on the newly emerging doctrine of divine right. While they are God’s representative on earth, they ultimately derive their authority based on the agreement amongst the people. But if the people can give, why can they not lawfully take away? The theological core of Hobbes’s argument, that the agreement between subject and sovereign cannot be undone because it represents an agreement with God, is the contradiction that brings his theory to the ground. As an aside, Leviathan’s combination of theology together with the novelty of what would become social contract theory reveals the root of the latter to lie in the emphasis on covenants within the Calvinist tradition.

I find Leviathan a vile tractate, and it should serve as a warning to those who would deny idealism its place in human affairs. In addition, the fact that it’s written in Ye Olde Aenglish, while certainly no fault of Hobbes, made this a tedious and difficult read. The latter half’s focus on ecclesiology, inserted to deny the church an authority independent of the sovereign, while it completes Hobbes's world view, is full-to-the-brim with references to Mosaic law which only adds to the work’s anachronistic feel. Far better to spend your time with the liberalism of John Stuart Mill.

479,Jacob Aitken,"In the beginning of his treatise Hobbes stays very close to the “Received Tradition.” He does make some troubling moves, though, and quite subtlely. He rejects the idea of a “Summum Bonum.” His definition of natural law leaves out any reference to the eternal law or the mind of God. He views liberty as a zero-sum game and anticipates (with approval) predatory capitalism.

Key themes:

Anthropology: Hobbes begins with anthropology, and his politics are logical inferences from it. Hobbes defines a “Body” as that which occupies space. Substance is matter, synonymous with body. The soul is simply the body living. He specifically rejects the idea that the soul is distinct from the body (639). Hobbes has defined man in purely material terms.

Not surprisingly, Hobbes rejects free agency. Liberty and necessity are the same thing: what a man does he freely does. Yet every act of man has a desire, and so a cause. And from that another cause, all the way back to the First Cause. This appears to be Jonathan Edwards’ view as well.

Social Contract: before the institution of the commonwealth, every man had a right to everything and by any means to preserve his own (354). This means that the State can never make an unjust law. P1: Justice is when two agree to an exchange (if you didn't agree, you wouldn't do the exchange).
P2: You agreed to invest the state with authority (social contract).
________________
Therefore, any law the state makes automatically has your agreement.

Zero-Sum ethics: Hobbes holds that what is mine cannot be yours; if the state has liberty, then the subject to that degree cannot. Since there is no summum bonum, there can be no sharing in the ultimate good. This, plain and simple, is the economics of Hell. Hobbes is not a pure capitalist, though. He argues elsewhere against private charity and for state welfare (387).

Religious Persecution

Hobbes argues that religious persecution is impossible, since 1) the state can't do wrong, and 2) only martyrs can be persecuted. Further (2a) a person can only be a martyr if they have seen the risen Jesus, which rules out everyone after the Apostle John. Therefore, no one today can be a martyr. Keep in mind that thousands of Scottish Covenanters were being butchered on the basis of Hobbes’ argument. This reminds me of a time at RTS when a local Reformed pastor came in the book store and told me that he held to Hobbes’s view of the state. I kept my mouth shut because I didn’t want to end up in a FEMA camp.

Critique

My critique will follow Dabney’s (The Sensualistic Philosophy, pp. 15-20). Hobbes has to pay a high price for his materialism. If everything reduces to sensation, then whence come numbers, mind, any correspondence between my mind and the external world, all a priori judgments, logic, and abstract entities?

If everything is sensation, then what unites the sensations? (Hume’s famous line “a bundle of sensations”) Hobbes would have to answer yet another sensation. But what unites that sensation to the previous sensations? Ad infinitum. If Hobbes bites the bullet and rejects the need for a unity, then he needs to give up concepts like identity (and probably the concept of ""concept"" itself). This is the fatal consequence in rejecting philosophical realism. Hobbes is split between the One and the Many. His power-state collapses everything into the One, yet his nominalism reduces everything to an aggregate of an unconnected Many.

Conclusion

I give the book 1 star for its demonic content and 5 stars for its influence. Indeed, rebutting Hobbes is like casting down demonic strongholds (2 Corinthians 10). It’s fairly easy to read and there is no mistaking its influence (the “Father of Political Science”).",False,,,1551,254,2.0,,,en,"In beginning treatise Hobbes stays close “Received Tradition.” He make troubling moves, though, quite subtlely.

480,Garrett Cash,"I am pleased to report that Thomas Hobbes's landmark work of political philosophy is not ""poor, nasty, brutish, and short.""
It is exceedingly well-written, systematic, lucid, and quite compelling.
Despite the fact that I am certainly not what you would call a monarchist, I was frankly quite surprised at how much I tended to agree with Hobbes's arguments. His conclusions are quite logical and grounded in a view of human nature that I would tend to agree with. His view was that we're only an absence of an authoritarian government away from all killing each other. He makes several great points on why it makes more sense to choose a monarchy over democracy or aristocracy (which he concluded were really the only three forms of commonwealth). I'm so convinced of the veracity of his arguments that I've actually scared myself. What if I'm a monarchist deep down? Time to read Paine's again and see if my head should be straightened.

P.S. This would easily be a five star book if it were not for the long-winded section on the Christian commonwealth in the second half of the book. is actually four books put into one, so if I were to rate them all separately I would give five stars to and , and four stars to and .

P.P.S. I've been wanting to read this book for a long time, but I finally read it for a class I'm currently taking at my church that's a sort of ""books that screwed up the world"" course. I found it interesting because we started with a sort of pair of Machiavelli's and . I had read before and I loved it, so I was interested to find out how I liked and why my professor thought it was bad enough to put on this list.

Hobbes shows a deep understanding of Scripture and theology, and I agreed with his theological assessments on the major issues. He clearly understands the Gospel and how salvation is obtained. As to his supposed Biblical skepticism, he says: ""I am persuaded that they [church scribes] did not therefore falsify the Scriptures, though the copies of the books of the New Testament were in the hands only of the ecclesiastics; because if they had had the intention of doing so, they would surely have made them more favourable to their power over Christian princes, and civil sovereignty, then they are. I see not therefore any reason to doubt, but that the Old, and New Testament, as we have them now, are the true registers of those things, which were done and said by the prophets, and apostles.""

481,Luke,"Let me begin by saying that I agree with some of Hobbes philosophy, but certainly not all of it. Perhaps this'll change over time, perhaps it won't. But in practical terms, it will not work. I do not even believe it would've worked in Hobbes time, and in the modern World, certainly not.

On some of his laws of nature, I agree. Indeed, some of these are entrenched in our society today - whether that be the right to a judge and not allowing any man to be his own judge. Of laws on complaisance, against arrogance, pride, for self-preservation, to seek peace - indeed, to measure law on, in the sentence Hobbes uses 'Do not that to another, which thou wouldest not have done to thy sefle' - I cannot disagree with it. I find no fault there. But on laws for equity, holding things in common proportionately, deciding by lot who gets what - some of these really aren't, to me, laws of nature, nor are they objectively right. But when he speaks against the Papacy and wrongful interpretation for their own gain (although he himself advocating the sovereign deciding what is right to prevent discord is distasteful, and supports Tuck's view on Christian Atheism) - I can't disagree either. His analysis of humanity is especially true. But as I said, his views on Christianity are at times differing to mine, and his views sometimes are distasteful.

But when Hobbes speaks of the need for an absolute sovereign, I am not entirely convinced. I believe in the requirement of an elite. In aristocrats, as it were. I believe in a sovereign, in a sovereign that holds unquestionable authority and worth as it is with Her Majesty. But in theory, whilst Hobbes can dress it up, in practice it would not occur. Hobbes seems to have the same idea as Plato that the king, or sovereign, would be entirely and wholesomely perfect. This is not so. This never has been so. Hobbes can dress it up that he would be bound by the Covenant and his principle rights, by the biblical Word of God and Christ, by the Natural Laws that will govern man - but this won't happen - indeed, in some of the laws, it is implicit he already realises this. Yes, there'll be the great Monarchs of our time - Queen Elizabeth II as an absolute sovereign would be a fine pick, Henry the Eighth would've been fine before he went mad, but these are few and far between. And it was only through power being counteracted that it could be so that moral and political retardation occurs - not so at the moment of course, and so such retardation has occurred, but the need for a Parliament, the need for a sovereign too - these are paramount. We cannot have an absolute sovereign, Hobbes' explicitly disallows such power being divided as he rightly points out it will make them fall, because it simply cannot work.

So indeed, I believe wholly in the Laws of Nature. I believe some things Hobbes has written on. But on the core principle? I'm struggling. And on his thoughts on Hell? I, too, have a different view. And I think I'll keep on struggling on. He's undoubtedly a great writer and deserves his place. And the edition I read, the Cambridge edition, is a great one with a fantastic introduction and great accompaniments, all the while plainly set out.

482,Marks54,"I had been reading Peter Ackroyd's history of Britain and just finished the third volume, which cover the time from James I to the Glorious Revolution. As you might expect, there is lots of talk about religion and government - and what the proper relationship between the two should be. That is where Hobbes' masterpiece Leviathan was mentioned. I had read selections from the book long ago and am familiar with the core arguments that remain tied to Hobbes today. I got the urge to go back to Leviathan and read the entire work.

After doing so, I now recognize why Leviathan is abridged. The core arguments remain and are brilliant. This is a variant of social contract thinking based power, fear, and the need to avoid the chaos of a world without government which is akin to a ""war of all against all"" in which life is ""nasty, brutish, and short"". People agree to give power to Leviathan to assure social order and permit society to develop. When one considers the time in which Hobbes was writing, the time of the English Civil War and the execution of Charles I, an approach to government of this sort seems reasonable.

Hobbes is a great political theorist and his tract of filled with discussions of power, authority, legality, and contract. It is especially interesting to see what a contract based theory looks like more than a century before Adam Smith published the Wealth of Nations. There is relatively little discussion of contracts as promoting efficient outcomes and quite a lot of discussion about fairness, enforcement, clarity, and fair dealing -- what would be talked about today in terms of agency issues.

What Hobbes is talking about the earthly commonwealth, its basis, and its operations, he is sparkling. Most of the book, however, discusses the basis of a Christian Commonwealth and issues around what the authority of earthly rulers should be over church matters and what the authority of churchmen should be over earthly affairs. Hobbes spends a lot of time (really a good deal of time) staking out the position that earthly authority, while coming from God, rests in the hands of the Monarch and not the Head of the Church - unless the Head of the Church is also an earthly rulers - such as the Pope with the Papal states. To do this, Hobbes brings to bear is knowledge of Greek and Latin and his thorough knowledge of scripture to support his position.

While Hobbes is very smart and thorough, it is clear that these arguments regarding the Christian Commonwealth have not retained the salience in current thinking that they once had. This is why the book is abstracted and selections presented. It is illuminating, however, to see arguments about the need to control divergent religious beliefs as a basis of social stability in light of current developments in the MIddle East and South Asia. Even in the US, while the main issues in the Church and State debates seems to have been settled, they are never far from the surface as one examines the more controversial cases before the Supreme Court.

Üniversite ikinci sınıftayken sadece ""hukuk felesefesi""ni ilgilendiren kısımlarını okumuştuk, -orijinal dilinin de ağır olması nedeniyle- o zamandan bu yana Türkçesinden okumak istiyordum Leviathan'ı. Özellikle hukukla, siyasetle ilgilenen kimselerin mutlaka okuması gereken bir kitap olduğunu düşünüyorum, hakikaten birçok konuyu kapsaması bakımından büyük bir önem teşkil ediyor. Kitap, dört bölümden oluşmakta: İnsan Üzerine, Devlet Üzerine, Hristiyan Bir Devlet Üzerine, Karanlığın Krallığı Üzerine. İlk iki bölümü zevkle okudum; ancak son iki bölümdeki Hristiyan dini ilgili konuların bolluğu bu konularla çok haşır neşir olmadığımdan beni biraz bunalttı.

Hobbes'un temel felsefesi, insanların eşit olduğu üzerine kurulu. İnsanlar eşit ve her şey üzerinde eşit haklara sahipler. İşte bu nedenle de A'nın istediğini B de isteyebilir ve ikisinin de o şey üzerinde aynı hakkı vardır. A, o şeyi elde etmek için B'yi yok edebilir, bir bakıma bunu yapmak durumundadır da ve bu da adaletsiz ya da yanlış olmaz. Diğer bir ifadeyle her insanın eşit oluşu, kişiyi bir diğerini yok etmeye ya da egemenliği altına almaya çalışmasına yöneltmektedir. Hal böyle olunca da doğa durumundaki insan daimi bir savaş içindedir. İşte Hobbes'a göre insanlar, savaş durumundan barış durumuna geçebilmek adına, güvenliklerinin sağlanabilmesi amacıyla birtakım haklarından feragat ederler ve bu haklarını bir ""egemen""e devrederler. Bu doğa yasalarının bir sonucudur. Yani insanın aklıyla keşfettiği ve kendisine zarar verecek şeyleri yapmamasını emreden yasaların sonucudur. Birinci doğa yasası barışı aramak ve izlemektir, ikincisi ise barışı sürdürmek. İkinci yasaya uymak adına haklarını egemene, üstün güce, devreden insanlar daha sonra bundan dönemezler. Aksi bir durum adil değildir. Bu noktadan sonra da insanlar egemenlerine koşulsuz şartsız uymakla yükümlüdürler.

Hobbes'un devletin ortaya çıkış nedeni olarak sunduğu görüşlere yakın hissediyorum kendi görüşlerimi; ancak Hobbes'un egemene gereğinden fazla yetkiler yüklediğini düşünüyorum. Örneğin Hobbes, egemenin en sonunda bir tirana dönüşmesinin bile savaş durumundan daha iyi olacağını savunuyor. Hobbes'a göre haklarını devredenlerin daha sonradan devrettikleri kişiye karşı ayaklanmaları mümkün değil, ayaklansalar da bu doğru değildir. Ayrıca Hobbes egemeni bir nevi ""yanılmaz güç"" olarak ilân ediyor; çünkü egemenin diğer insanlardan yetki aldığını, yetkilerini aldığı kişilere karşı da onların yetkileriyle haksızlık edemeyeceğini savunuyor. Egemen insafsızlık edebilir; ancak bu tam bir adaletsizlik ya da haksızlık değildir diyor; ama beni kesinlikle ikna edemediğini belirtmem lazım.

484,Brett,"Leviathan is a historically important document and a cornerstone of early political philosophy, but boy does it feel distant from the concerns of the modern world. The argument Hobbes makes boils down to some version of this: when there is no absolute ruling authority in a polis, factions are bound to engage in struggle and eventually combat with each other for political power. In Hobbes' estimation, these civil wars are an evil to be avoided at all costs, hence the need for a strong ruler that can prevent them from taking place.

Without this rule, man exist in what Hobbes refers to as a ""state of nature."" This state is a dog eat dog, everyone for themselves, dystopia. It's a view of human nature that has some plausibility--we've all seen people behave in self-interested and self-centered ways. The famous quote that you will be familiar with from Leviathan is as follows: ""the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.""

It is perhaps an understandable position given the reality of the English civil war that Hobbes lived through. But most of us have come around to a more rounded view of the human race. We are at times selfish, of course. But that is not the totality of the human experience. And in these hundreds of years since Leviathan, nations have had a good deal of success with various experiments in democracy. In the present day, when even the most revanchist writer at least must nod in the direction of democracy to obtain credibility, it can be hard to come to terms with Hobbes' critique.

Over time, we have drifted further from Hobbes' point of view, and most of us are thankful that we have done so. Sure, we have plenty of disputes over how much democracy is the optimal amount, and whether we may be better off with experts making some decisions (a la the Fed) but few would openly argue it is prudent to entirely remove the public from the decision making process.

When Hobbes is done denigrating the Greek and Roman systems of democracy, he is anxious to explain why he thinks Christianity supports his view of politics. Then, really the entire back half of the book is dedicated to long-winded arguments about some of the finer points of Christian belief. I will charitably call this section ""not engaging"" and note that I often found that I had read several pages and had no memory what had ostensibly passed through my mind.

I will also lodge a minor complaint that the language of the book is in no way updated from Hobbes' original, meaning the modern reader has to do a fair amount of parsing of language to come to an understanding of what each passage means. Maybe I am just being lazy, but I would have appreciated an editor that could have clarified some of the writing to make it easier on me.

So this falls into that category of book that I read out of some misplaced sense of obligation. Something possesses me to try to engage with these kinds of primary documents on a regular basis, but I almost always come away frustrated. It's entirely possible that you, the theoretical future reader of this book, are a better student than me, and will find the sublime core of insight that I have missed.

I found a big difference between his view and that of Locke or Rousseau, his materialistic views were shown in his work, considering the time the book was written in it must have created a big controversy about it, challenging everything had been there.

The difference between him and what I have read before is his views about human nature and man kind ,war of every man against every man, that showed we only tend to destroy one another and so we seek peace.

His views on the rights of sovereigns on their subjects and the right of their subject in the commonwealth I didn't like that as he based all his arguments on the christian perspective.On all of that he supports a constitutional monarchy instead of republicanism or any form with a monarchy ruling like all I was reading about, but he based a good ground for civil right and legislation and the idea of the social contract to form the Leviathan.

He wrote the book during the civil war so I can see why he supported a constitutional monarchy as a form of stability and to stop the killing in a form of a common ground.

490,James Hatton,"Gadzooks! This was a hard book to read!

“Leviathan” was published in 1651, which is smack dab in the middle of the Early Modern English period (1500-1800). Hobbes was born in 1588, twenty-four years after Shakespeare, so his word choices and sentence structures are similar. On top of that, he seems to have a lot to say, and in dreadful detail. At the end of the second part of the book he declares, “… for it is short, and I think clear…” Well, no, Thomas, you’ve been neither short nor clear. And on top of that, brother, the next two parts (III and IV) go downhill from here. I did not read the last two parts (III and IV); but not because they’re hard to read—more on this below. I did read A Review and Conclusion, at the very end. Overall, it was tough for me. It was worth reading, but no fun—two stars.

Still, if you have an interest in the topics of the book per se (i.e. political science, social contract, state of nature—solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short, etc.), or if you have an interest in a veiled condemnation of Cromwell and the Parliamentarians on the other of the ax that beheaded Charles I, or if you’d like to read a carefully subtle condemnation of the English Civil War (1642-1651), or if you’d like to experience Early Modern English in all its baffling glory, then there’s a lot in this book for you. I recommend it to anyone with these interests.

(On why I did not read Parts III and IV)

This is the fourth time I’ve read this book. Around ten years ago, I read Parts I and II, and then stopped. Thereafter, I tried a couple more times, but stopped each time. I couldn’t remember why I stopped at Part III ten years ago, but now I remember. Part III begins two parts in which Hobbes tries to prove, or disprove all sorts of things in the Bible, and things comprised in the contemporaneous theology of his countrymen. I believe any SUCH EFFORT IS TOTALLY MISSING THE POINT OF THE BIBLE! The Bible does not need to be proved, or disproved. I do recommend reading the Bible. I’ve read it several times. But the important message therein is paramount: love God and love one another (Leviticus 19:18, Matthew 32:37-40, John 13:34-35). And by the way, it's a command, not a message.

493,Alex,"I suppose having to read this as part of a course, may, to some extent tarnish ones appreciation of a book. Perhaps this is one of the first reasons why I choose to give Leviathan only 2 stars. Let me start by saying that any student of politics would find Hobbes to be truly invaluable especially if you wish to philosophically critique the majority of things political.

Of course, we must also realise the Hobbes, writing when he did, is now almost impenetrable and arduous to read, expressly convoluted, headache inducing stuff, that should you actually understand what he means, will require reading more than once.

Here comes my next issue with the book. Hobbes, for all his understanding of the 'state of nature' and the 'social contract', has logical discrepancies in his statements, he deems, that to escape from an environment of constant turmoil, death and destruction, man must enter into a social contract, and, as far as he is concerned suspend almost every single one of his natural rights.

Hobbes does allow some, for example, this leviathan that rules over man may not force man to do harm to himself, nor to go to war for him, man may refuse that much. Oh but Hobbes says that it is ok for Man to be executed should he refuse the leviathans request to go to war, so I guess that freedom that man may maintain isn't really that much of a freedom at all.

Additionally, I would argue that Hobbes becomes increasingly irrelevant when considering modern political society, the type of dictatorial notions that Hobbes advocates no longer have a place in modern democracy, though, with adaption, may have a place in providing an argument for greater authoritarianism.

In all, I would not exactly recommend this book to anybody that subscribes to a modern school of political thought, its not likely to sharpen your arsenal, of course, for a student of politics, definitely worth while.",False,,,34,1,2.0,,,en,"I suppose read part course, may, extent tarnish ones appreciation book.

494,Nathan,"What I like most about this work is this: Hobbes was one of the first philosophers to liken human beings to a machine. A mechanistic, materialistic view of humanity. A strong empiricism (not as strong as Hume, but still strong nonetheless). His famous view of nature as being ""natural, brutish, and short"" echoes and rings true. His view of man as being primarily self-interested and the collective being a social contract is still something I am debating. It is an important work because while it is a heavily Christian, conservative work which promotes social hierarchy, it is nevertheless revolutionary for its time. It challenges the view of man as innately rational and gets to the root of the human being as acting towards their own self-interest; their ideas and sense of self being an accumulation of what has been seen, heard, felt, and tasted. While I don't agree with this sentiment and do not share the same view of man; and while it is incredibly basic and undeveloped, I do think it is important to read and study this text in order to understand one of the fundamentals of our Western mode of thinking - the mechanistic view of humanity, which is still ever-present today. While Hobbes is not the sole contributor to this view, he is an important part of its development.

495,Aman,"Though I do not agree that we need a strong sovereign daddy power to rule us, this is a foundational text in social contract theory, and the arguments are much more interesting than they were portrayed by my high school teachers. Hobbes's ideas on a state of nature, his theory of how we form covenants and why they are only possible with a sovereign, his theory of representation, etc.; it's all definitely more intricate than ""people are selfish!""

I think that last fact is the most important take-away: Hobbes doesn't just say ""people are selfish by nature"", but rather that people are inclined to by nature (the Natural Law). Thus, in a , to survive as a solitary person, it is only rational to do whatever one can to survive because the conditions prevent any individual from knowing what any other individual is thinking. The safest belief is that everyone will be acting the same way: to protect themselves. So, you must do what you can to protect yourself (the Natural Right). This is like what we call now the Prisoner's Dilemma, or the Security dilemma, or pretty much the entire field of IR, and more. How do we solve this (according to Hobbes)? Contract it uppp!!!! And we need a single sovereign, to whom everyone equally yields their rights, to administrate and adjudicate.

That being said, reading this book still doesn't convince me that the is a good tool/analytical framework, and so, his conclusion is kinda bleh.

Whether or not you believe Monarchy is the best form of government, Hobbes nailed many of our current problems on the head. The famous ""nature raw in tooth and claw"" quote is embedded in a chapter of almost pure poetry. That chapter alone makes the book worthwhile. Elsewhere, there are plenty of quotes to pick and choose from:
Unnecessary Lawes are not good Lawes; but trapps for Mony....
...the Law is more easily understood by few, than many words. For all words, are subject to ambiguity; and therefore multiplication of words in the body of the Law, is multiplication of ambiguity....

497,Oscar Despard,"This is a work which left me quite conflicted. The brilliant and, frankly, the ignorant coexist beside each other, and a wonderfully rigorous exposition cohabitates with a strange rant against Aristotle and, to quote a heading, ‘absurdities in natural philosophy, as gravity the cause of heaviness’.

The perspicacious analysis of the polity is clouded by lengthy sections on theology, which seemed tangential to the text. Of course, religion was in no way tangential to the politics of Hobbes’ day, but he did little to link any of the religious elements to his primary thesis, and they were not necessary to it at all. A short examination would have sufficed, but Hobbes undermines both my trust in him and the intellectual rigour of his argument by indulging in theology without giving any attempt to justify its role.

However, to appreciate its brilliance, one need only look at the relative paucity of axioms Hobbes relies on for his conclusions. Whereas in Kant and Locke, we see large assumptions about universal rights, which are necessary to provide any grounds for the arguments either of those eminent philosophers made, Hobbes proceeds on blatantly obvious ‘laws of nature’ to provide a convincing argument. This does lead to problems; Hobbes gives no way to change an unsatisfactory commonwealth because he does not think that such a thing can exist.

In conclusion, I believe that ‘Leviathan’ probably gives more truth in political philosophy than many other texts. However, Hobbes’ limitations mean that it does not give a complete political system, and his section on a Christian commonwealth is a largely unnecessary distraction.

Hobbes take an essentially negative view of the human species: we're selfish jerks who will keep beating on each other unless a firm, authoritative government exists to curtail our animal urges.

Hobbes then espouses upon the insanely minute details of this hypothetical government, while managing to hate on everything from women (he calls cowardly males ""men of feminine courage"")and philosophers to any religion that is NOT Christianity (e.g. WRONG).

Although his theoretical government may be ruled by either a king or an assembly, Hobbes was clearly cozying up to the royal family with his clear preference for a monarchy, in which the king should have unlimited, unchecked powers over his country, supposedly to prevent civil war.

But to me, the most impressive was Hobbes' insights about nature of human beings.

Because there is scarcity in society, all of us are in the perpetual competition for power. This competition leads to distrust and jealousy among people, and eventually to conflict.

Hobbes does not simply state that the monarch has a divine right to rule his subjects, he attempts to analyse the logic of the mechanisms by which kings enjoy the rights they do and what dangers threaten society should their rights be disputed. He does not say that everything is right in a monarchy, simply that it might be even worse without a monarch to moderate human weaknesses and volatility.

He does not introduce radically new ideas, most echo contemporary political reality, he simply tries to extrapolate the implications of political claims taken to their most extreme conclusion.

Leviathan is of its time, the mid-seventeenth century when the modern idea of a sovereign state system was coming into being (The Westphalian System). One ought to remember that a sovereign need not necessarily be a king, or dictator but a body with ultimate political power. Most modern republics are also sovereign in this sense.

My initial reaction to this book was to recoil at Hobbes' pessimistic view of mankind in his 'state of nature'. However, although I believe such a state of nature to be entirely an artificial hypothetical construct, on further examination there is much empirical evidence about human behaviour that would support Hobbes' observation (e.g. Somalia today). I think Hobbes arguments are at their most compelling when he is treating of the competing claims to authority made by a sovereign and those who believe they have authority directly from God to create a theocracy.

In this dialogue Hobbes comes closest to actually ridiculing Christian orthodoxy, rather than leveling a critique at scholasticism.

Anyway, yeah. Um, I am not one to rate this book.
