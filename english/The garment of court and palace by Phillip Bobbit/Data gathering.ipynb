      "  We recently toured Rome and Italy, where we viewed many of the splendors of the Italian Renaissance. Works by Michelangelo, Titian, and Rafael were prominent. The spirit of Leonardo da Vinci loomed in the background. These figures and others like them are considered among the glories of the Italian Renaissance. But perhaps the most important person to emerge from the Italian Renaissance was not a painter, sculptor, or poet. He was a Florentine diplomat sent involuntarily into exile from Florence to a country estate, where he took up his pen and began writing. He drew upon his deep knowledge of ancient history and Florentine history. He drew upon his extensive practical experience from many years as a Florentine diplomat. After his death, one of his works, On Principalities, was published. Immediately, it was subject to mistranslation, misunderstanding, and abridgment. It became known as the Courtier's Koran (and this is not a compliment). Who was this person? Niccolò Machiavelli. His name has become familiar through the centuries since the publication of The Prince (as the title was misleadingly translated into English) as a purveyor of sinister political advice. Almost every major commentator addressing all  the history of political thought has grappled with Machiavelli’s works and wrestled with his legacy. In this book, Philip Bobbitt enters the fray.Philip Bobbitt is a professor of law at Columbia University with continuing ties to his original teaching position at the University of Texas. In addition, he has served in foreign-policy positions under both Republican and Democrat administrations. Finally, and most recently, he has published two major works on law, strategy, and international relations: The Shield of Achilles and War and Consent. Compared to those two books, his foray into the world of Machiavellian studies is brief and succinct. However, Bobbitt has a compelling hypothesis and makes a strong case in favor of his interpretation.Bobbitt argues that The Prince is a short detour from Machiavelli's longer work, the Discourses on Livy, which helped create the intellectual climate that allowed the resurgence of Republicanism in the Western world. Bobbitt argues that The Prince and the Discourses should be read as one book on the state (il stato). Instead of Machiavelli writing a “mirror of princes” work like his predecessors, Machiavelli is attempting something else. In The Prince Machiavelli aims to establish a practical ethics for establishing a state (principality). After the establishment of the state, Machiavelli recommends a transition to a republican form of government. Machiavelli undertakes this intellectual project in the hope that Italy will one day unify into a single state under a republican government, a hope that was not realized until several centuries after his death. In forwarding this argument, Bobbitt does not see Machiavelli as a teacher of evil, but as an astute student of political realities that is willing to weigh the consequences of action and not pay mere lip service to ethical guidelines that don't deal with the reality of those grasping for political power.I found Bobbitt's argument convincing. Most who read Machiavelli have to admit that he has insights into the behavior of those grasping or seeking power (i.e., all of us). His classic query is to whether it is better to be loved or to be hated, a question that has a practical ring to it for personal relations as much as for political rule. Many readers over the centuries have felt that in taking any advice from Machiavelli one was somehow lowering oneself in a dastardly way, but this is not (necessarily) so. Machiavelli tries to establish the guidelines for founding a state (or regime or scheme of power) that can be later transferred into a more stable republic.Bobbitt's argument about Machiavelli makes a lot of sense, but it also leaves many unanswered questions. The review of the book by Garry Wills in the New York Times suggest that Bobbitt’s book tacitly approves of a powerful state that will limit civil liberties and unduly aggrandize the regime. Wills seems to believe that Bobbitt’s argument grants license to the Dick Cheneys of the world to do as they will in protection of the state. I didn't read Bobbitt as making that argument, although I am curious to go back and look more closely at The Shield of Achilles and especially Terror and Consent to learn how Bobbitt draws these lines. Bobbitt does ignore the question of when Machiavelli’s ethics of The Prince should no longer apply. In other words, a newly formed principality, according to Machiavelli and Bobbitt, must work under different set of guidelines than an established republic. However, to what extent can a republic or should a republic revert to the ethics of a principality when under threat? Indeed, history seems littered with examples of political leaders who grasp for power when external forces threaten. The identification of an external threat is the oldest trick in the playbook for extending political power. According to Machiavelli and Bobbitt, how do we sort out the legitimate expediencies that Machiavelli might consider legitimate from those that would prove harmful to a republic? Our own republic has undergone a serious decline in civil liberties under the terrorist threats of the last 20 years, and before that, under the threat of communism. Despite the warnings of people like George Kennan, throughout the Cold War the US too often mimicked our adversaries in paranoia, state security, and limitations on freethinking. The same thing can be happening in the current age, although Al Qaeda and Islamic fundamentalism don’t pose the ideological threat that Marxism once held as an attractive messianic religion.For anyone who is remotely interested in Machiavelli and the world in which he lived and acted, I highly recommend Bobbitt's book. Bobbitt is not a Machiavelli scholar, but he has done his homework and marshaled his arguments in a way that is convincing and appealing. I hope his next book will address the application of Machiavelli and Machiavellian principles in today's world and how we can distinguish between the legitimate uses of power and their easy corruption.\n",

      "  International lawyer and historian Philip Bobbitt offers us a fundamental reinterpretation of Niccolo Machiavelli’s “The Prince.” Instead of it being a manual for tyrants “The Prince” is, in fact, an outline for the modern state that was to arise out of the feudal order. Bobbitt calls this new governmental form the “princely state” which he dates from the Treaty of Augsburg of 1555. For the reader not familiar with Bobbitt’s “Shield of Achilles,” his history of governmental order, this book can be rough going.“The Garments of Court and Palace” combines a long book review with a biography of Machiavelli. To him Machiavelli’s priorities were to create a state to enhance the public good and to unify the feudal states of Italy into a unified whole. He puts into perspective one of Machiavelli’s most famous aphorisms, “the ends justify the means.” Taken literally this is a license for extreme actions, but Bobbitt notes that to Machiavelli the means have to be proportionate to the ends. When viewed this way, Machiavelli’s aphorism is a constraint on a ruler rather than a license.Bobbitt has a lengthy discussion on the role of “virtu” and fortune in the affairs of a prince. “Virtu” here is defined as skill and resoluteness and fortune is the role of chance. A prince has to be constantly aware that fortune can overwhelm skill and effort or make a failed policy successful. Flexibility is the key and this also applies to previously entered treaties that no longer serve their original intent. Here I would add the comment of the 20th century political philosopher and baseball executive Branch Rickey who noted the “luck is the residue of design.” In other words a prince has to make his own breaks.Machiavelli understood the feudal world was dying and a new form of governmental organization was required. To him a republic governed by a prince sensitive to the needs of his populace was the wave of the future.Again as I noted above this book can be difficult going, but if the reader wants to get a sense of Machiavelli, his thoughts and the world he would make, it is worth the effort.\n",

      "  This compact work succeeds in presenting Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" in a new and authoritative light. Bobbitt contends that \"The Prince\" can only be properly understood as part of a larger body work. Along with Machiavelli's \"The Discourses,\" the two form the grand work \"The State.\" In \"The State\" Machiavelli contends that feudalism is dying such that central Italy must form a new neoclassical state in order for it protect its people. At the very least Bobbitt presents an original understanding of Machiavelli in this work. After 500 years of study, that alone is a remarkable achievement.\n",

      "  These errors have nothing to do with Machiavelli, but they constitute gratuitous comments that suggest that the author should stick to his areas of expertise.1. \"President Abraham Lincoln ... suspended habeas corpus during the American Civil War--in direct contradiction of a specific provision of the US Constitution. ...\" (p. 55.) Article I, section 9, of the US Constitution states, \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" No historian doubts that the Civil War constituted a case of rebellion in which the public safety may have required the suspension of habeas corpus. The only question is who may suspend habeas corpus: the President or the Congress?  This question has never been settled. Therefore, although one may argue that Lincoln acted unconstitutionally, he did not act \"in direct contradiction of a specific provision of the US Constitution.\"2. \"In July 2010 it was reported that 80 per cent of Americans believed that President Kennedy's assassination was the work of a conspiracy, despite the repeated and unequivocal repudiation of this idea by reputable historians.\" (p. 217.) The author does not name even one such historian; nor does he state whether any reputable historians take the other side. Rather, he implies falsely that the question has been settled among reputable historians. But what does he even mean by \"reputable historian\"? The two best-known books, apart from the Warren Commission report, that advocate that Oswald was the lone assassin were not written by academic historians.  The late Vincent Bugliosi was a lawyer, and Gerald Posner, formerly a lawyer, is a journalist.3. Savonarola's \"burning at the stake.\"  (p. 82.) Savonarola was hanged, and his corpse was burned, at least according to his biographers Lauro Martines and Donald Weinstein, as well as Machiavelli scholar Harvey Mansfield, in his WSJ review of Corrado Vivanti's \"Niccolo Machiavelli: An Intellectual Biography.\" In Lauro Martines' biography of Savonarola, \"Fire in the City,\" he writes that Savonarola and two other men were \"led up a ladder and hanged, and then all were burned to ashes.\" (p. 275)Nevertheless, in his review of Robert Black's \"Machiavelli,\" in TLS (Jan. 31, 2014), Martines refers to \"the burning of Savonarola.\" That sounds odd. We do speak of cremating so and so, but, in the context in which Bobbitt, and Martines in TLS, refer to Savonarola's \"burning,\" we'd expect them to speak of burning his corpse, not him. Yet, because Martines knew that Savonarola was hanged and nevertheless spoke of his \"burning,\" perhaps Bobbitt knew that too, and is guilty in this instance of no more than ambiguous writing.Nevertheless, in \"Fire in the City,\" Martines writes that \"the executioner set fire to the great mound of straw and firewood. ... For some moments a wind seemed to turn the flames away from the hanging bodies, but they were soon enveloped.\" (p. 276) So it seems that Savonarola's corpse was not removed from the gallows, or whatever Savonarola was hanged from, before it was burned. Therefore, even if we excuse Bobbitt's comment that Savonarola, as opposed to his corpse, was burned, it was not burned at the stake.\n",

Despite the warnings of people like George Kennan, throughout the Cold War the US too often mimicked our adversaries in paranoia, state security, and limitations on freethinking. The same thing can be happening in the current age, although Al Qaeda and Islamic fundamentalism don’t pose the ideological threat that Marxism once held as an attractive messianic religion.For anyone who is remotely interested in Machiavelli and the world in which he lived and acted, I highly recommend Bobbitt's book. Bobbitt is not a Machiavelli scholar, but he has done his homework and marshaled his arguments in a way that is convincing and appealing. I hope his next book will address the application of Machiavelli and Machiavellian principles in today's world and how we can distinguish between the legitimate uses of power and their easy corruption.\n",

      "  International lawyer and historian Philip Bobbitt offers us a fundamental reinterpretation of Niccolo Machiavelli’s “The Prince.” Instead of it being a manual for tyrants “The Prince” is, in fact, an outline for the modern state that was to arise out of the feudal order. Bobbitt calls this new governmental form the “princely state” which he dates from the Treaty of Augsburg of 1555. For the reader not familiar with Bobbitt’s “Shield of Achilles,” his history of governmental order, this book can be rough going.“The Garments of Court and Palace” combines a long book review with a biography of Machiavelli. To him Machiavelli’s priorities were to create a state to enhance the public good and to unify the feudal states of Italy into a unified whole. He puts into perspective one of Machiavelli’s most famous aphorisms, “the ends justify the means.” Taken literally this is a license for extreme actions, but Bobbitt notes that to Machiavelli the means have to be proportionate to the ends. When viewed this way, Machiavelli’s aphorism is a constraint on a ruler rather than a license.Bobbitt has a lengthy discussion on the role of “virtu” and fortune in the affairs of a prince. “Virtu” here is defined as skill and resoluteness and fortune is the role of chance. A prince has to be constantly aware that fortune can overwhelm skill and effort or make a failed policy successful. Flexibility is the key and this also applies to previously entered treaties that no longer serve their original intent. Here I would add the comment of the 20th century political philosopher and baseball executive Branch Rickey who noted the “luck is the residue of design.” In other words a prince has to make his own breaks.Machiavelli understood the feudal world was dying and a new form of governmental organization was required. To him a republic governed by a prince sensitive to the needs of his populace was the wave of the future.Again as I noted above this book can be difficult going, but if the reader wants to get a sense of Machiavelli, his thoughts and the world he would make, it is worth the effort.\n",

      "  These errors have nothing to do with Machiavelli, but they constitute gratuitous comments that suggest that the author should stick to his areas of expertise.1. \"President Abraham Lincoln ... suspended habeas corpus during the American Civil War--in direct contradiction of a specific provision of the US Constitution. ...\" (p. 55.) Article I, section 9, of the US Constitution states, \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" No historian doubts that the Civil War constituted a case of rebellion in which the public safety may have required the suspension of habeas corpus. The only question is who may suspend habeas corpus: the President or the Congress?  This question has never been settled. Therefore, although one may argue that Lincoln acted unconstitutionally, he did not act \"in direct contradiction of a specific provision of the US Constitution.\"2. \"In July 2010 it was reported that 80 per cent of Americans believed that President Kennedy's assassination was the work of a conspiracy, despite the repeated and unequivocal repudiation of this idea by reputable historians.\" (p. 217.) The author does not name even one such historian; nor does he state whether any reputable historians take the other side. Rather, he implies falsely that the question has been settled among reputable historians. But what does he even mean by \"reputable historian\"? The two best-known books, apart from the Warren Commission report, that advocate that Oswald was the lone assassin were not written by academic historians.  The late Vincent Bugliosi was a lawyer, and Gerald Posner, formerly a lawyer, is a journalist.3. Savonarola's \"burning at the stake.\"  (p. 82.) Savonarola was hanged, and his corpse was burned, at least according to his biographers Lauro Martines and Donald Weinstein, as well as Machiavelli scholar Harvey Mansfield, in his WSJ review of Corrado Vivanti's \"Niccolo Machiavelli: An Intellectual Biography.\" In Lauro Martines' biography of Savonarola, \"Fire in the City,\" he writes that Savonarola and two other men were \"led up a ladder and hanged, and then all were burned to ashes.\" (p. 275)Nevertheless, in his review of Robert Black's \"Machiavelli,\" in TLS (Jan. 31, 2014), Martines refers to \"the burning of Savonarola.\" That sounds odd. We do speak of cremating so and so, but, in the context in which Bobbitt, and Martines in TLS, refer to Savonarola's \"burning,\" we'd expect them to speak of burning his corpse, not him. Yet, because Martines knew that Savonarola was hanged and nevertheless spoke of his \"burning,\" perhaps Bobbitt knew that too, and is guilty in this instance of no more than ambiguous writing.Nevertheless, in \"Fire in the City,\" Martines writes that \"the executioner set fire to the great mound of straw and firewood. ... For some moments a wind seemed to turn the flames away from the hanging bodies, but they were soon enveloped.\" (p. 276) So it seems that Savonarola's corpse was not removed from the gallows, or whatever Savonarola was hanged from, before it was burned. Therefore, even if we excuse Bobbitt's comment that Savonarola, as opposed to his corpse, was burned, it was not burned at the stake.\n",

      "  This book is both profound and beautifully written--so beautifully that it periodically stopped me in my tracks and forced me to go back and re-read paragraphs just for the sheer beauty of the language...and that language is both specific and deeply meaningful.  Not since 'In Search of Lost Time' have I encountered writing which is so gorgeous--it renews the word 'jouissance' to writing, and is a cleansing shower for readers accustomed to either dry exposition or bombastic opinion.  Bobbitt reviews not only 'The Prince' but Machiavelli's the works, puts them in context of time/person/place, and approaches the world of literature written on Machiavelli since them--in fact, he journeys back in time to set the stage for 'The Prince'.  If you want to buy one book this year that is phenomenal: superbly written, massively researched, and written by a man with an encyclopedia knowledge, go for this.\n",

      "  Bobbitt's short and tight argument is that Machiavelli's Prince is really part of a wider project of describing the nature and necessity of a new form of rule, the modern state based on law and popular legitimacy rather than being the extension of the dynastic power or personal prowess of a single individual. This requires the Prince and the Discourses to be read as a single argument for creating large princely states in Italy to redeem her from the incursions of Spain, France and the empire, but with the twist that if princes had to found these new states their laws and civic arrangements had to be republican for them to endure. Bobbitt makes Machiavelli the visionary who made the modern state by imagining it despite the failure of his ideas  in their specific Italian and European historical context ( Bobbitt provides brief summaries, chronologies and bios which are quite helpful). This is an interesting claim, strongly advanced, but one that professional historians and political scientist would likely reject. In fact, like Machiavelli, Bobbitt is lawyer, government official and man of letters. As such, he has rescued Machiavelli from the academy and made him speak to our contemporary concerns.The one jarring note in the book comes at the end when Bobbitt asserts that what the modern state is being superseded by what he call the market state, an idea he has rehearsed elsewhere.With much evidence that the markets are being crushed by governments almost everywhere (see my  \"Broken Markets\" on this site) the market state seems very much a spent idea and not essential to this lively and elegantly written volume.Highly recommended\n",

      "  We recently toured Rome and Italy, where we viewed many of the splendors of the Italian Renaissance. Works by Michelangelo, Titian, and Rafael were prominent. The spirit of Leonardo da Vinci loomed in the background. These figures and others like them are considered among the glories of the Italian Renaissance. But perhaps the most important person to emerge from the Italian Renaissance was not a painter, sculptor, or poet. He was a Florentine diplomat sent involuntarily into exile from Florence to a country estate, where he took up his pen and began writing. He drew upon his deep knowledge of ancient history and Florentine history. He drew upon his extensive practical experience from many years as a Florentine diplomat. After his death, one of his works, On Principalities, was published. Immediately, it was subject to mistranslation, misunderstanding, and abridgment. It became known as the Courtier's Koran (and this is not a compliment). Who was this person? Niccolò Machiavelli. His name has become familiar through the centuries since the publication of The Prince (as the title was misleadingly translated into English) as a purveyor of sinister political advice. Almost every major commentator addressing all  the history of political thought has grappled with Machiavelli’s works and wrestled with his legacy. In this book, Philip Bobbitt enters the fray.Philip Bobbitt is a professor of law at Columbia University with continuing ties to his original teaching position at the University of Texas. In addition, he has served in foreign-policy positions under both Republican and Democrat administrations. Finally, and most recently, he has published two major works on law, strategy, and international relations: The Shield of Achilles and War and Consent. Compared to those two books, his foray into the world of Machiavellian studies is brief and succinct. However, Bobbitt has a compelling hypothesis and makes a strong case in favor of his interpretation.Bobbitt argues that The Prince is a short detour from Machiavelli's longer work, the Discourses on Livy, which helped create the intellectual climate that allowed the resurgence of Republicanism in the Western world. Bobbitt argues that The Prince and the Discourses should be read as one book on the state (il stato). Instead of Machiavelli writing a “mirror of princes” work like his predecessors, Machiavelli is attempting something else. In The Prince Machiavelli aims to establish a practical ethics for establishing a state (principality). After the establishment of the state, Machiavelli recommends a transition to a republican form of government. Machiavelli undertakes this intellectual project in the hope that Italy will one day unify into a single state under a republican government, a hope that was not realized until several centuries after his death. In forwarding this argument, Bobbitt does not see Machiavelli as a teacher of evil, but as an astute student of political realities that is willing to weigh the consequences of action and not pay mere lip service to ethical guidelines that don't deal with the reality of those grasping for political power.I found Bobbitt's argument convincing. Most who read Machiavelli have to admit that he has insights into the behavior of those grasping or seeking power (i.e., all of us). His classic query is to whether it is better to be loved or to be hated, a question that has a practical ring to it for personal relations as much as for political rule. Many readers over the centuries have felt that in taking any advice from Machiavelli one was somehow lowering oneself in a dastardly way, but this is not (necessarily) so. Machiavelli tries to establish the guidelines for founding a state (or regime or scheme of power) that can be later transferred into a more stable republic.Bobbitt's argument about Machiavelli makes a lot of sense, but it also leaves many unanswered questions. The review of the book by Garry Wills in the New York Times suggest that Bobbitt’s book tacitly approves of a powerful state that will limit civil liberties and unduly aggrandize the regime. Wills seems to believe that Bobbitt’s argument grants license to the Dick Cheneys of the world to do as they will in protection of the state. I didn't read Bobbitt as making that argument, although I am curious to go back and look more closely at The Shield of Achilles and especially Terror and Consent to learn how Bobbitt draws these lines. Bobbitt does ignore the question of when Machiavelli’s ethics of The Prince should no longer apply. In other words, a newly formed principality, according to Machiavelli and Bobbitt, must work under different set of guidelines than an established republic. However, to what extent can a republic or should a republic revert to the ethics of a principality when under threat? Indeed, history seems littered with examples of political leaders who grasp for power when external forces threaten. The identification of an external threat is the oldest trick in the playbook for extending political power. According to Machiavelli and Bobbitt, how do we sort out the legitimate expediencies that Machiavelli might consider legitimate from those that would prove harmful to a republic? Our own republic has undergone a serious decline in civil liberties under the terrorist threats of the last 20 years, and before that, under the threat of communism. Despite the warnings of people like George Kennan, throughout the Cold War the US too often mimicked our adversaries in paranoia, state security, and limitations on freethinking. The same thing can be happening in the current age, although Al Qaeda and Islamic fundamentalism don’t pose the ideological threat that Marxism once held as an attractive messianic religion.For anyone who is remotely interested in Machiavelli and the world in which he lived and acted, I highly recommend Bobbitt's book. Bobbitt is not a Machiavelli scholar, but he has done his homework and marshaled his arguments in a way that is convincing and appealing. I hope his next book will address the application of Machiavelli and Machiavellian principles in today's world and how we can distinguish between the legitimate uses of power and their easy corruption.\n",

      "  The Garments of Court and Palace poses an interesting challenge for me. It is essentially a review of Machiavelli's The Prince.  A 288 page book review. How much more can one say? How does a reviewer review a review? Worse (or better yet), Bobbitt  does in his review what readers of my reviews come to expect of me: a completely different take, with aspects and interpretations no other reviewer has caught, and which sometimes the author has missed, being mired in the trees of the forest.The discovery here would never have occurred to me. It is that The Prince is actually a study in the evolution of constitutional government, and not a recipe for oppression and subjugation of a people. Only someone steeped in constitutional law and philosophy would interpret it that way, but Bobbitt makes an absolutely commanding case for it. In fact, by massaging Machiavelli into this thesis, Bobbitt solves a number of contradictions and conundrums that reviews have used to criticize Machiavelli and diminish his accomplishment with his book, which by the way, he never called The Prince.In places, it is positively Talmudic in its incorporation of outside voices and critics. Commentators through the ages are shredded or vetted. He backs his premise thoroughly and completely, enlisting Machiavelli's words despite centuries of them being interpreted in a completely different direction. It is fascinating.Millions of us (had to) read The Prince in high school. Our teachers drummed into us exactly what it was about, and all our appreciation of it was framed in that context. But it's wrong. And that makes this book compelling, valuable, and important.I'm delighted to have come across it.David Wineberg\n",

      "  This book is an original contribution to understanding of Machiavelli. Bobbitt views Machiavelli as an innovative thinker on constitutions who wrote a book on the state which includes both The Prince and Discourses on Levy. It as a whole laid the foundations for a neoclassical state system in the making while supporting republican regimes.Bobbitt provides other important understandings, such as on Machiavelli¡¯s morality of ¡°necessity¡± and consequentialism, and the ethical duty of rulers to follow different moral reasoning in their acts as an agency of the public and in their personal life. This explanation puts to shame common options on the immorality of The Prince based on wrong reading and inadequate understanding of the project of Machiavelli as a whole.Leaving aside many other important points, let me focus on the central idea of Machiavelli as emphasized in this book: Virt¨' (in the sense of Machiavelli as explained on page 77, but unacceptable is the English term ¡°manly virtuosity¡± suggested by Bobbitt), requires from both rulers and political entities to adjust to changing conditions, otherwise failure is assured. Political leaders are bound by their personality and experience and therefore fail to do so. But a well-structured political entity changes rulers so as to make them fit novel conditions, this being a great advantage of ¡°republics.¡±This important evolutionary perspective also applies, most importantly so, to constitutions and state systems. These too have to adjust to novel situations, otherwise decline and failure are assured with harsh consequences. Therefore Machiavelli  emphasized the importance of foundational rulers, while Bobbitt emphasized the importance of Machiavelli as recognizing the obsolescence of the prevailing state system and proposing an appropriate new model.Never mind that Bobbitt seems to share the overly optimistic views of Machiavelli on the virt¨± of ¡°republics,¡± based on misreading of much of Roman history in the Discourses. The idea of transforming state systems so as to prevent failure when situations change, as proposed by Machiavelli and well discussed by Bobbitt, is of profound importance. But it leads to a harsh conclusion, namely the impermanence of contemporary widely accepted state system and their grounding basic norms.It is here that Bobbitt makes what I regard a serious error. In the Epilogue he presents the ¡°market state¡± as a fitting adjustment of the state system to emerging conditions, such as globalization, mass media, and so on ¨C an idea fully developed in other books by him. But, granting the advantages of market states (which is not obvious at all), the author  ignores the inadequacy of market states too for coping with the fateful challenges posed to humanity by the potentials of self-destruction and ruinous ¡°enhancement¡± provided by science and technology.Following the striking insights of Machiavelli as well presented by Bobbitt, the very nature of states and regimes will have to change radically in order to avoid catastrophes and facilitate human thriving. Thus, a authoritative global regime strictly regulating the development and diffusion of dangerous knowledge and devices and the uses of ¡°human enhancements¡± may become essential for the survival of the human species and its pluralistic flourishing.Such thoughts stimulated by this book make it into compelling reading, highly recommended for all concerned about the future of democracy, of the present state system, and of humanity as a whole. But the Epilogue needs more than a grain of salt. Professor Yehezkel DrorThe Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n",

      "  The strange title must be a reminder that Italian princely states of Machiavelli's era were not the same as modern nation states. Nevertheless Bobbit examines applicability of Machiavelli's ideas to modern politics as reality based rather than the common wishful thinking of liberal politicians. Primarily Machiavelli distinguishes political reality from liberal ethics. Other writers call it doing bad by doing good, something Machiavelli counsels to avoid.Bobbitt claims Machiavelli was a republican at heart. Most of his diplomatic career was with the Florentine republic between its two Medici episodes. One must read 'Discourses' with 'Prince' as one working philosophy. He broke off 'Discourses' to examine the princely state after the return of the Medici to Florence. It was not originally titled 'The Prince' a somewhat misleading title as is that of this book.Bobbitt calls him the most important political theorist since Thucydides. Far from his amoral reputation he simply separated politics from ethics. His recommended reality based politics avoids wishful thinking and hypocrisy, so common in modern politics. Another lesson for the present is that a nation is not a state. Examples include Kurds, Basques, Palestinians, Tamils and Cherokees. An adversary of the Renaissance Church, Machiavelli, 300 years before Marx, recognized the use of religion to manipulate minds.A most Interesting part of the book studies Alexander and Cesare's attempt at uniting the vicarage states of the Romagna with the republic of Florence as a device to eliminate French and Spanish influence from central Italy. Eventually control was to be relinquished to a republican government. Had he succeeded, I doubt whether Cesare Borgia would have subscribed to that idea. Reasons for Machiavelli's admiration of Cesare with attendant contempt for Julius II is unclear but very interesting. Julius carried on Cesare's aim of uniting the Romagna. The idea that Cesare held a strong hand at the death of his father might be overstated by Bobbitt. Machiavelli excusing Cesare's failure as due to adverse fortune seems a departure from reality politics. His purported solution to the paradox of fortune appears to be just a historical study, albeit a very interesting one.It's a bit of double think for the modern ethical reader to see that Machiavelli's ruthless realism was, and still is, for the good of the state. It's a refreshing deviation from the current mindless altruism in politics that does so much harm by trying to do good.\n",

      "  This small book attempts to reassess Machivavelli, a person who has come to be identified with amorality, especially in politics, by proffering a new interpretation of his thoughts based on his life and all his writings. I am not sure it really succeeds.The basis of the argument is that in just considering The Prince, Machiavelli's most famous and infamous work, most people have gotten a skewed and incomplete picture of his political philosophy. In considering that work as just a part of the whole which also includes Machiavelli's other major book, Discourses on the First Ten Books of Livy, the author believes that what is really being offered is a brilliant new constitutional structure, the princely state, which is the direct antecedent of the modern nation state.The importance of this idea is that in formulating a new political structure, one necessitated by the military conflicts of 16th century Italy, Machiavelli is creating a sovereign entity that has needs that supersede those if its ruler[s] and hence the Prince has a moral obligation to attend to those requirements even at the risk of violating his personal moral and ethics. At the same time he is circumscribed in his actions by what is necessary for the good of the state.Having read only The Prince, I cannot address the question of whether or not by linking it so integrally with the Discourses it's interpretation is substantially changed, but for arguments sake let's say it is. Even then the author has to really twist and turn in trying to justify Machiavelli's various advice so as to remove the odious reputation that has attached itself to it as the result of ideas like  \"ends justify the means\" and \"might makes right\". In the end, the basic justification offered is that of utilitarian morality- that in a state that which is necessary for the common and greater good is ethical and indeed demanded, and that means that the Prince is vindicated in his actions as long as he is the agent of this \"good\".It seems to me that the author has just replaced one problem with another here. Instead of being amoral, Machiavelli can now be accused of being immoral if you disagree with utilitarianism, which many do. After all, if killing is absolutely wrong for an individual, why would it be correct for a state?  I don't want to get into this argument, which is an intellectually and morally intriguing debate. All I am pointing out is that by taking this path I am not sure the author has purged Machiavelli of the accusations that have dogged him over the centuries.As for the belief that it is a new interpretation to believe that Machiavelli was suggesting a radical political revolution in the form of a Republican form of government with it's attendant laws and liberties, again I am not qualified to judge this. In reading this author I am struck by how modern Machiavelli sounds, but whether this is a result of his prescience or the author's liberal interpretation, I cannot say.I do have one last comment, which pertains to this book but is also a generalization. This is a relatively short book [ the end of the epilogue is on page 184]. Recently I have read a number of books, both fiction and non-fiction, which I would also call short [the latest book in a popular fiction series was almost half the length of the previous books]. In considering this recent phenomenon I have begun to wonder if the advent of e-books, with their ease of publication and  difficulty knowing the length before you buy it, may be contributing to this explosion of stunted volumes. Maybe I am just overly suspicious and all these books would have been written anyway, but a part of me says there is no way they would have seen the light of day at these prices before the broad acceptance of the digital format. I love to read but hate to feel like I am being taken advantaged of. Publishers and authors take note.\n",
