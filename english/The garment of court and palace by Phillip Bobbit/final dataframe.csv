  This book is both profound and beautifully written--so beautifully that it periodically stopped me in my tracks and forced me to go back and re-read paragraphs just for the sheer beauty of the language...and that language is both specific and deeply meaningful.  Not since 'In Search of Lost Time' have I encountered writing which is so gorgeous--it renews the word 'jouissance' to writing, and is a cleansing shower for readers accustomed to either dry exposition or bombastic opinion.  Bobbitt reviews not only 'The Prince' but Machiavelli's the works, puts them in context of time/person/place, and approaches the world of literature written on Machiavelli since them--in fact, he journeys back in time to set the stage for 'The Prince'.  If you want to buy one book this year that is phenomenal: superbly written, massively researched, and written by a man with an encyclopedia knowledge, go for this.

  Bobbitt's short and tight argument is that Machiavelli's Prince is really part of a wider project of describing the nature and necessity of a new form of rule, the modern state based on law and popular legitimacy rather than being the extension of the dynastic power or personal prowess of a single individual. This requires the Prince and the Discourses to be read as a single argument for creating large princely states in Italy to redeem her from the incursions of Spain, France and the empire, but with the twist that if princes had to found these new states their laws and civic arrangements had to be republican for them to endure. Bobbitt makes Machiavelli the visionary who made the modern state by imagining it despite the failure of his ideas  in their specific Italian and European historical context ( Bobbitt provides brief summaries, chronologies and bios which are quite helpful). This is an interesting claim, strongly advanced, but one that professional historians and political scientist would likely reject. In fact, like Machiavelli, Bobbitt is lawyer, government official and man of letters. As such, he has rescued Machiavelli from the academy and made him speak to our contemporary concerns.The one jarring note in the book comes at the end when Bobbitt asserts that what the modern state is being superseded by what he call the market state, an idea he has rehearsed elsewhere.With much evidence that the markets are being crushed by governments almost everywhere (see my  ""Broken Markets"" on this site) the market state seems very much a spent idea and not essential to this lively and elegantly written volume.Highly recommended

  This is a great book! Places Machiavelli in context and in a completely different light than how is typically represented in current day references. Turns out he recognized the emergence of the state as a separate political entity long before others, and that he was a very ethical, principled man seeking the greatest good for the citizens of the state. Thought-provoking, excellent read.

  We recently toured Rome and Italy, where we viewed many of the splendors of the Italian Renaissance. Works by Michelangelo, Titian, and Rafael were prominent. The spirit of Leonardo da Vinci loomed in the background. These figures and others like them are considered among the glories of the Italian Renaissance. But perhaps the most important person to emerge from the Italian Renaissance was not a painter, sculptor, or poet. He was a Florentine diplomat sent involuntarily into exile from Florence to a country estate, where he took up his pen and began writing. He drew upon his deep knowledge of ancient history and Florentine history. He drew upon his extensive practical experience from many years as a Florentine diplomat. After his death, one of his works, On Principalities, was published. Immediately, it was subject to mistranslation, misunderstanding, and abridgment. It became known as the Courtier's Koran (and this is not a compliment). Who was this person? Niccolò Machiavelli. His name has become familiar through the centuries since the publication of The Prince (as the title was misleadingly translated into English) as a purveyor of sinister political advice. Almost every major commentator addressing all  the history of political thought has grappled with Machiavelli’s works and wrestled with his legacy. In this book, Philip Bobbitt enters the fray.Philip Bobbitt is a professor of law at Columbia University with continuing ties to his original teaching position at the University of Texas. In addition, he has served in foreign-policy positions under both Republican and Democrat administrations. Finally, and most recently, he has published two major works on law, strategy, and international relations: The Shield of Achilles and War and Consent. Compared to those two books, his foray into the world of Machiavellian studies is brief and succinct. However, Bobbitt has a compelling hypothesis and makes a strong case in favor of his interpretation.Bobbitt argues that The Prince is a short detour from Machiavelli's longer work, the Discourses on Livy, which helped create the intellectual climate that allowed the resurgence of Republicanism in the Western world. Bobbitt argues that The Prince and the Discourses should be read as one book on the state (il stato). Instead of Machiavelli writing a “mirror of princes” work like his predecessors, Machiavelli is attempting something else. In The Prince Machiavelli aims to establish a practical ethics for establishing a state (principality). After the establishment of the state, Machiavelli recommends a transition to a republican form of government. Machiavelli undertakes this intellectual project in the hope that Italy will one day unify into a single state under a republican government, a hope that was not realized until several centuries after his death. In forwarding this argument, Bobbitt does not see Machiavelli as a teacher of evil, but as an astute student of political realities that is willing to weigh the consequences of action and not pay mere lip service to ethical guidelines that don't deal with the reality of those grasping for political power.I found Bobbitt's argument convincing. Most who read Machiavelli have to admit that he has insights into the behavior of those grasping or seeking power (i.e., all of us). His classic query is to whether it is better to be loved or to be hated, a question that has a practical ring to it for personal relations as much as for political rule. Many readers over the centuries have felt that in taking any advice from Machiavelli one was somehow lowering oneself in a dastardly way, but this is not (necessarily) so. Machiavelli tries to establish the guidelines for founding a state (or regime or scheme of power) that can be later transferred into a more stable republic.Bobbitt's argument about Machiavelli makes a lot of sense, but it also leaves many unanswered questions. The review of the book by Garry Wills in the New York Times suggest that Bobbitt’s book tacitly approves of a powerful state that will limit civil liberties and unduly aggrandize the regime. Wills seems to believe that Bobbitt’s argument grants license to the Dick Cheneys of the world to do as they will in protection of the state. I didn't read Bobbitt as making that argument, although I am curious to go back and look more closely at The Shield of Achilles and especially Terror and Consent to learn how Bobbitt draws these lines. Bobbitt does ignore the question of when Machiavelli’s ethics of The Prince should no longer apply. In other words, a newly formed principality, according to Machiavelli and Bobbitt, must work under different set of guidelines than an established republic. However, to what extent can a republic or should a republic revert to the ethics of a principality when under threat? Indeed, history seems littered with examples of political leaders who grasp for power when external forces threaten. The identification of an external threat is the oldest trick in the playbook for extending political power. According to Machiavelli and Bobbitt, how do we sort out the legitimate expediencies that Machiavelli might consider legitimate from those that would prove harmful to a republic? Our own republic has undergone a serious decline in civil liberties under the terrorist threats of the last 20 years, and before that, under the threat of communism. Despite the warnings of people like George Kennan, throughout the Cold War the US too often mimicked our adversaries in paranoia, state security, and limitations on freethinking. The same thing can be happening in the current age, although Al Qaeda and Islamic fundamentalism don’t pose the ideological threat that Marxism once held as an attractive messianic religion.For anyone who is remotely interested in Machiavelli and the world in which he lived and acted, I highly recommend Bobbitt's book. Bobbitt is not a Machiavelli scholar, but he has done his homework and marshaled his arguments in a way that is convincing and appealing. I hope his next book will address the application of Machiavelli and Machiavellian principles in today's world and how we can distinguish between the legitimate uses of power and their easy corruption.

  International lawyer and historian Philip Bobbitt offers us a fundamental reinterpretation of Niccolo Machiavelli’s “The Prince.” Instead of it being a manual for tyrants “The Prince” is, in fact, an outline for the modern state that was to arise out of the feudal order. Bobbitt calls this new governmental form the “princely state” which he dates from the Treaty of Augsburg of 1555. For the reader not familiar with Bobbitt’s “Shield of Achilles,” his history of governmental order, this book can be rough going.“The Garments of Court and Palace” combines a long book review with a biography of Machiavelli. To him Machiavelli’s priorities were to create a state to enhance the public good and to unify the feudal states of Italy into a unified whole. He puts into perspective one of Machiavelli’s most famous aphorisms, “the ends justify the means.” Taken literally this is a license for extreme actions, but Bobbitt notes that to Machiavelli the means have to be proportionate to the ends. When viewed this way, Machiavelli’s aphorism is a constraint on a ruler rather than a license.Bobbitt has a lengthy discussion on the role of “virtu” and fortune in the affairs of a prince. “Virtu” here is defined as skill and resoluteness and fortune is the role of chance. A prince has to be constantly aware that fortune can overwhelm skill and effort or make a failed policy successful. Flexibility is the key and this also applies to previously entered treaties that no longer serve their original intent. Here I would add the comment of the 20th century political philosopher and baseball executive Branch Rickey who noted the “luck is the residue of design.” In other words a prince has to make his own breaks.Machiavelli understood the feudal world was dying and a new form of governmental organization was required. To him a republic governed by a prince sensitive to the needs of his populace was the wave of the future.Again as I noted above this book can be difficult going, but if the reader wants to get a sense of Machiavelli, his thoughts and the world he would make, it is worth the effort.

  This is an excellent brief study that draws attention to the legal and constitutional aspects of Machiavelli’s thought often overlooked by those who read only with an eye to foreign policy and military strategy.

  This compact work succeeds in presenting Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" in a new and authoritative light. Bobbitt contends that ""The Prince"" can only be properly understood as part of a larger body work. Along with Machiavelli's ""The Discourses,"" the two form the grand work ""The State."" In ""The State"" Machiavelli contends that feudalism is dying such that central Italy must form a new neoclassical state in order for it protect its people. At the very least Bobbitt presents an original understanding of Machiavelli in this work. After 500 years of study, that alone is a remarkable achievement.

  This is an amazing book, that rare thing, adding a new idea to the marketplace of ideas.  It is a little bit of hard slog, but well work the effort.  It gets one to put Machiavelli in his context and gets one to think about modern history from a slightly new angle.

  These errors have nothing to do with Machiavelli, but they constitute gratuitous comments that suggest that the author should stick to his areas of expertise.1. ""President Abraham Lincoln ... suspended habeas corpus during the American Civil War--in direct contradiction of a specific provision of the US Constitution. ..."" (p. 55.) Article I, section 9, of the US Constitution states, ""The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."" No historian doubts that the Civil War constituted a case of rebellion in which the public safety may have required the suspension of habeas corpus. The only question is who may suspend habeas corpus: the President or the Congress?  This question has never been settled. Therefore, although one may argue that Lincoln acted unconstitutionally, he did not act ""in direct contradiction of a specific provision of the US Constitution.""2. ""In July 2010 it was reported that 80 per cent of Americans believed that President Kennedy's assassination was the work of a conspiracy, despite the repeated and unequivocal repudiation of this idea by reputable historians."" (p. 217.) The author does not name even one such historian; nor does he state whether any reputable historians take the other side. Rather, he implies falsely that the question has been settled among reputable historians. But what does he even mean by ""reputable historian""? The two best-known books, apart from the Warren Commission report, that advocate that Oswald was the lone assassin were not written by academic historians.  The late Vincent Bugliosi was a lawyer, and Gerald Posner, formerly a lawyer, is a journalist.3. Savonarola's ""burning at the stake.""  (p. 82.) Savonarola was hanged, and his corpse was burned, at least according to his biographers Lauro Martines and Donald Weinstein, as well as Machiavelli scholar Harvey Mansfield, in his WSJ review of Corrado Vivanti's ""Niccolo Machiavelli: An Intellectual Biography."" In Lauro Martines' biography of Savonarola, ""Fire in the City,"" he writes that Savonarola and two other men were ""led up a ladder and hanged, and then all were burned to ashes."" (p. 275)Nevertheless, in his review of Robert Black's ""Machiavelli,"" in TLS (Jan. 31, 2014), Martines refers to ""the burning of Savonarola."" That sounds odd. We do speak of cremating so and so, but, in the context in which Bobbitt, and Martines in TLS, refer to Savonarola's ""burning,"" we'd expect them to speak of burning his corpse, not him. Yet, because Martines knew that Savonarola was hanged and nevertheless spoke of his ""burning,"" perhaps Bobbitt knew that too, and is guilty in this instance of no more than ambiguous writing.Nevertheless, in ""Fire in the City,"" Martines writes that ""the executioner set fire to the great mound of straw and firewood. ... For some moments a wind seemed to turn the flames away from the hanging bodies, but they were soon enveloped."" (p. 276) So it seems that Savonarola's corpse was not removed from the gallows, or whatever Savonarola was hanged from, before it was burned. Therefore, even if we excuse Bobbitt's comment that Savonarola, as opposed to his corpse, was burned, it was not burned at the stake.

  There has always been a disconnect between The Prince and the Discourses, as well was with Machiavelli's life in Florence.  Bobbitt ties it all together as a coherent and rational world-view.

  The Garments of Court and Palace poses an interesting challenge for me. It is essentially a review of Machiavelli's The Prince.  A 288 page book review. How much more can one say? How does a reviewer review a review? Worse (or better yet), Bobbitt  does in his review what readers of my reviews come to expect of me: a completely different take, with aspects and interpretations no other reviewer has caught, and which sometimes the author has missed, being mired in the trees of the forest.The discovery here would never have occurred to me. It is that The Prince is actually a study in the evolution of constitutional government, and not a recipe for oppression and subjugation of a people. Only someone steeped in constitutional law and philosophy would interpret it that way, but Bobbitt makes an absolutely commanding case for it. In fact, by massaging Machiavelli into this thesis, Bobbitt solves a number of contradictions and conundrums that reviews have used to criticize Machiavelli and diminish his accomplishment with his book, which by the way, he never called The Prince.In places, it is positively Talmudic in its incorporation of outside voices and critics. Commentators through the ages are shredded or vetted. He backs his premise thoroughly and completely, enlisting Machiavelli's words despite centuries of them being interpreted in a completely different direction. It is fascinating.Millions of us (had to) read The Prince in high school. Our teachers drummed into us exactly what it was about, and all our appreciation of it was framed in that context. But it's wrong. And that makes this book compelling, valuable, and important.I'm delighted to have come across it.David Wineberg

  This book is an original contribution to understanding of Machiavelli. Bobbitt views Machiavelli as an innovative thinker on constitutions who wrote a book on the state which includes both The Prince and Discourses on Levy. It as a whole laid the foundations for a neoclassical state system in the making while supporting republican regimes.Bobbitt provides other important understandings, such as on Machiavelli¡¯s morality of ¡°necessity¡± and consequentialism, and the ethical duty of rulers to follow different moral reasoning in their acts as an agency of the public and in their personal life. This explanation puts to shame common options on the immorality of The Prince based on wrong reading and inadequate understanding of the project of Machiavelli as a whole.Leaving aside many other important points, let me focus on the central idea of Machiavelli as emphasized in this book: Virt¨' (in the sense of Machiavelli as explained on page 77, but unacceptable is the English term ¡°manly virtuosity¡± suggested by Bobbitt), requires from both rulers and political entities to adjust to changing conditions, otherwise failure is assured. Political leaders are bound by their personality and experience and therefore fail to do so. But a well-structured political entity changes rulers so as to make them fit novel conditions, this being a great advantage of ¡°republics.¡±This important evolutionary perspective also applies, most importantly so, to constitutions and state systems. These too have to adjust to novel situations, otherwise decline and failure are assured with harsh consequences. Therefore Machiavelli  emphasized the importance of foundational rulers, while Bobbitt emphasized the importance of Machiavelli as recognizing the obsolescence of the prevailing state system and proposing an appropriate new model.Never mind that Bobbitt seems to share the overly optimistic views of Machiavelli on the virt¨± of ¡°republics,¡± based on misreading of much of Roman history in the Discourses. The idea of transforming state systems so as to prevent failure when situations change, as proposed by Machiavelli and well discussed by Bobbitt, is of profound importance. But it leads to a harsh conclusion, namely the impermanence of contemporary widely accepted state system and their grounding basic norms.It is here that Bobbitt makes what I regard a serious error. In the Epilogue he presents the ¡°market state¡± as a fitting adjustment of the state system to emerging conditions, such as globalization, mass media, and so on ¨C an idea fully developed in other books by him. But, granting the advantages of market states (which is not obvious at all), the author  ignores the inadequacy of market states too for coping with the fateful challenges posed to humanity by the potentials of self-destruction and ruinous ¡°enhancement¡± provided by science and technology.Following the striking insights of Machiavelli as well presented by Bobbitt, the very nature of states and regimes will have to change radically in order to avoid catastrophes and facilitate human thriving. Thus, a authoritative global regime strictly regulating the development and diffusion of dangerous knowledge and devices and the uses of ¡°human enhancements¡± may become essential for the survival of the human species and its pluralistic flourishing.Such thoughts stimulated by this book make it into compelling reading, highly recommended for all concerned about the future of democracy, of the present state system, and of humanity as a whole. But the Epilogue needs more than a grain of salt. Professor Yehezkel DrorThe Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

  The strange title must be a reminder that Italian princely states of Machiavelli's era were not the same as modern nation states. Nevertheless Bobbit examines applicability of Machiavelli's ideas to modern politics as reality based rather than the common wishful thinking of liberal politicians. Primarily Machiavelli distinguishes political reality from liberal ethics. Other writers call it doing bad by doing good, something Machiavelli counsels to avoid.Bobbitt claims Machiavelli was a republican at heart. Most of his diplomatic career was with the Florentine republic between its two Medici episodes. One must read 'Discourses' with 'Prince' as one working philosophy. He broke off 'Discourses' to examine the princely state after the return of the Medici to Florence. It was not originally titled 'The Prince' a somewhat misleading title as is that of this book.Bobbitt calls him the most important political theorist since Thucydides. Far from his amoral reputation he simply separated politics from ethics. His recommended reality based politics avoids wishful thinking and hypocrisy, so common in modern politics. Another lesson for the present is that a nation is not a state. Examples include Kurds, Basques, Palestinians, Tamils and Cherokees. An adversary of the Renaissance Church, Machiavelli, 300 years before Marx, recognized the use of religion to manipulate minds.A most Interesting part of the book studies Alexander and Cesare's attempt at uniting the vicarage states of the Romagna with the republic of Florence as a device to eliminate French and Spanish influence from central Italy. Eventually control was to be relinquished to a republican government. Had he succeeded, I doubt whether Cesare Borgia would have subscribed to that idea. Reasons for Machiavelli's admiration of Cesare with attendant contempt for Julius II is unclear but very interesting. Julius carried on Cesare's aim of uniting the Romagna. The idea that Cesare held a strong hand at the death of his father might be overstated by Bobbitt. Machiavelli excusing Cesare's failure as due to adverse fortune seems a departure from reality politics. His purported solution to the paradox of fortune appears to be just a historical study, albeit a very interesting one.It's a bit of double think for the modern ethical reader to see that Machiavelli's ruthless realism was, and still is, for the good of the state. It's a refreshing deviation from the current mindless altruism in politics that does so much harm by trying to do good.

"
16,Joseph Devita,"

  This small book attempts to reassess Machivavelli, a person who has come to be identified with amorality, especially in politics, by proffering a new interpretation of his thoughts based on his life and all his writings. I am not sure it really succeeds.The basis of the argument is that in just considering The Prince, Machiavelli's most famous and infamous work, most people have gotten a skewed and incomplete picture of his political philosophy. In considering that work as just a part of the whole which also includes Machiavelli's other major book, Discourses on the First Ten Books of Livy, the author believes that what is really being offered is a brilliant new constitutional structure, the princely state, which is the direct antecedent of the modern nation state.The importance of this idea is that in formulating a new political structure, one necessitated by the military conflicts of 16th century Italy, Machiavelli is creating a sovereign entity that has needs that supersede those if its ruler[s] and hence the Prince has a moral obligation to attend to those requirements even at the risk of violating his personal moral and ethics. At the same time he is circumscribed in his actions by what is necessary for the good of the state.Having read only The Prince, I cannot address the question of whether or not by linking it so integrally with the Discourses it's interpretation is substantially changed, but for arguments sake let's say it is. Even then the author has to really twist and turn in trying to justify Machiavelli's various advice so as to remove the odious reputation that has attached itself to it as the result of ideas like  ""ends justify the means"" and ""might makes right"". In the end, the basic justification offered is that of utilitarian morality- that in a state that which is necessary for the common and greater good is ethical and indeed demanded, and that means that the Prince is vindicated in his actions as long as he is the agent of this ""good"".It seems to me that the author has just replaced one problem with another here. Instead of being amoral, Machiavelli can now be accused of being immoral if you disagree with utilitarianism, which many do. After all, if killing is absolutely wrong for an individual, why would it be correct for a state?  I don't want to get into this argument, which is an intellectually and morally intriguing debate. All I am pointing out is that by taking this path I am not sure the author has purged Machiavelli of the accusations that have dogged him over the centuries.As for the belief that it is a new interpretation to believe that Machiavelli was suggesting a radical political revolution in the form of a Republican form of government with it's attendant laws and liberties, again I am not qualified to judge this. In reading this author I am struck by how modern Machiavelli sounds, but whether this is a result of his prescience or the author's liberal interpretation, I cannot say.I do have one last comment, which pertains to this book but is also a generalization. This is a relatively short book [ the end of the epilogue is on page 184]. Recently I have read a number of books, both fiction and non-fiction, which I would also call short [the latest book in a popular fiction series was almost half the length of the previous books]. In considering this recent phenomenon I have begun to wonder if the advent of e-books, with their ease of publication and  difficulty knowing the length before you buy it, may be contributing to this explosion of stunted volumes. Maybe I am just overly suspicious and all these books would have been written anyway, but a part of me says there is no way they would have seen the light of day at these prices before the broad acceptance of the digital format. I love to read but hate to feel like I am being taken advantaged of. Publishers and authors take note.

Then how can he diet himself down to a mere 200 or so pages of text on Machiavelli? Bobbitt is a great systematizer in the Toynbee mold — “Shield” gave us six different state systems since 1500 (princely, kingly, territorial, imperial, national, ­market).“Terror” focused on one condition (the market state), but that state is still in formation, so Bobbitt argued its case more (and more and more) extensively. Then how does he deal with Machiavelli so compactly in “The Garments of Court and Palace”? Very easily, as one can tell by the frequency of his self-citations in the new book. He just shows us how wonderfully Machiavelli agreed with Bobbitt’s longer works — as if Niccolò had read them half a millennium ago. Machiavelli is often viewed as surprisingly modern, but does that have to mean he must be surprisingly Bobbitt?Machiavelli fits into Bobbitt’s scheme because he is the expounder of the first of the six state systems in “The Shield of Achilles,” the princely one (Machiavelli even graced the form with its Bobbittian name). Bobbitt believes that legal systems are changed by military strategies, often by military technology. So, in 1494, when Charles VIII brought bronze cannon into Italy, threatening fortress walls and smashing the governments that relied on them, Machiavelli had to propose new walls, along with new states to defend them. This must mean that Machiavelli was interested in new technologies for war — though in fact he was not very interested in forts (he thought they were less vulnerable to siege than to inner rebellion). In the encyclopedic “Art of War,” he suggests an improved design for forts, but he is still concerned with inner rebellion (he forbids an inner keep where the residents can hole up and tells us starvation is more effectual than siege). Nor did he invest his time or energy in the technological innovations of Leonardo (their one collaboration, diverting a river, was an ancient concept, and it failed).What Machiavelli was interested in was old systems, and especially old military systems — Roman ones, in fact. These were powerful not because they relied on new weapons but because they were based on virtù, an expression of their manly religion. Unlike Christianity, which makes people humble and otherworldly, Rome’s religion instilled a thirst for glory and freedom in this world. In Christianity “the ritual is more mincing (delicata) than grand, without fierce or manly (gagliarda) energy.” Roman “ritual was as grandly ceremonious, but it added the energy of a sacrifice deep in blood and fierceness, slaughtering hordes of animals. By being terrifying in this way, it made men just as terrifying.”Bobbitt thinks that Machiavelli’s prince could be ruthless, like the Romans, because he invented that new thing, “the princely state,” which must be preserved for the benefit of all. Thus crimes done for the state are no crimes. They are, in fact, rather altruistic. The prince must “subordinate all other indicia of right behavior to the one parameter of serving the state.” Those murdered are rightly murdered for being enemies of the state — a convenient rule for the prince, who is the state. He sacrifices himself to himself.Machiavelli is even made to endorse Bobbitt’s concept of the market state, on the rather broad ground that he was the “philosopher” of Bobbitt’s first state, so he would buy into the sixth one as “our sublime predecessor.” The new book is more vague than was “Terror and Consent” about the military obstetrics of the market state. Here Bobbitt just says it is “coming into being as a response to changes in the strategic context.” There he told us terrorism is at least the partial cause of the market state, which mirrors it. If Al Qaeda can operate freely across national entities, relying on modern communications, computer funding and ideological inventiveness, then we must do so too, calling on creative minds “free of many of the legal and political restraints that bind government officials.”This means continual outsourcing of previously governmental acts, and omnidirectional deregulation. The right must stop regulating abortion and pornography, the left must stop regulating hate speech and, through affirmative action, hiring — such acts “promote national values in defiance of the market.” Terrorists are “entrepreneurial,” so our market state must be an entrepreneurial state. Terrorists use the media, so we must use them (the media, we are told, are nimbler than bureaucrats). If they use Visa to finance strikes, so should we. We can abandon our own state limits to engage in “state building” around the world to cope with the terrorist state.Bobbitt says the market state has been in process of formation for a while. In “Shield” one of its prophets would seem to be Oliver North. The entrepreneurial Iran-contra (arms for hostages) transaction “anticipated the new market state,” and was “a natural market response to the problem of overregulation” (by overregulation he means the Boland Amendment against funding the contras in Nicaragua). Old nation-state rules should not hamper new market-state solutions. That is what Bobbitt says happened in the Iraq war. The open nation-state strategy was a quick decapitation of the Iraqi government. But since the war was with the mobile “virtual state” of terrorism, what was needed was a market state mirroring its tactics. (Blackwater and all the other private contractors were too hampered by the nation state, not yet acting as the market state.)But the best entrepreneur of the new counterterrorist terrorism was Dick Cheney, with his “enhanced interrogations” of captured terrorists. Bobbitt says torture may not be used just to score a political point or secure a judicial conviction. But the new state has to have new rules. In former wars, captives were forced to surrender their arms. In the new wars they must be forced to surrender their information. “There cannot be a ban on the collection of strategic information — information from terrorist leaders and senior managers — by whatever means are absolutely necessary short of inflicting severe pain when that information is likely to preclude attacks.” That is just the legal guidance Cheney got from John Yoo, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel. Neither Yoo nor Cheney thought waterboarding inflicted “severe pain.” The new prince, like Machiavelli’s old one, can commit crimes if they are in service to the state. The aim, after all, is to escape those “legal and political restraints that bind government officials.”It has often been noticed that war makes adversaries end up resembling each other; but Bobbitt would have us start out resembling our foe. Terrorists, he says, are not just criminals. They have created a “virtual state,” and we have to create an entirely new kind of state to cope with it. This reminds me of the people who denounced democracy in the 1930s as too slow and stumbling to respond to the rise of dictators. Some would have had Roose­velt and Churchill create a new kind of state, baffling dictators with “good guy” dictatorships.Not even Bobbitt thinks a new state was born of that crisis — his “nation state” runs unbroken from 1914 to 1990, and was able to survive World War II and the cold war. Only Al Qaeda and its ilk are enough to make us create an entirely new political order. Those who have seen the efficiency and lack of corruption in unregulated medicine and banks and Blackwater-type operations will have a little trouble hailing Machiavelli as a sponsor of the Higher Cheneyism.Garry Wills, emeritus professor of history at Northwestern University, is the author, most recently, of “Why Priests? A Failed Tradition.”

We recently toured Rome and Italy, where we viewed many of the splendors of the Italian Renaissance. Works by Michelangelo, Titian, and Rafael were prominent. The spirit of Leonardo da Vinci loomed in the background. These figures and others like them are considered among the glories of the Italian Renaissance. But perhaps the most important person to emerge from the Italian Renaissance was not a painter, sculptor, or poet. He was a Florentine diplomat sent involuntarily into exile from Florence
We recently toured Rome and Italy, where we viewed many of the splendors of the Italian Renaissance. Works by Michelangelo, Titian, and Rafael were prominent. The spirit of Leonardo da Vinci loomed in the background. These figures and others like them are considered among the glories of the Italian Renaissance. But perhaps the most important person to emerge from the Italian Renaissance was not a painter, sculptor, or poet. He was a Florentine diplomat sent involuntarily into exile from Florence to a country estate, where he took up his pen and began writing. He drew upon his deep knowledge of ancient history and Florentine history. He drew upon his extensive practical experience from many years as a Florentine diplomat. After his death, one of his works, On Principalities, was published. Immediately, it was subject to mistranslation, misunderstanding, and abridgment. It became known as the Courtier's Koran (and this is not a compliment). Who was this person? Niccolò Machiavelli. His name has become familiar through the centuries since the publication of The Prince (as the title was misleadingly translated into English) as a purveyor of sinister political advice. Almost every major commentator addressing all him him him him him him him him the history of political thought has grappled with Machiavelli’s works and wrestled with his legacy. In this book, Philip Bobbitt enters the fray.Philip Bobbitt is a professor of law at Columbia University with continuing ties to his original teaching position at the University of Texas. In addition, he has served in foreign-policy positions under both Republican and Democrat administrations. Finally, and most recently, he has published two major works on law, strategy, and international relations: The Shield of Achilles and War and Consent. Compared to those two books, his foray into the world of Machiavellian studies is brief and succinct. However, Bobbitt has a compelling hypothesis and makes a strong case in favor of his interpretation.Bobbitt argues that The Prince is a short detour from Machiavelli's longer work, the Discourses on Livy, which helped create the intellectual climate that allowed the resurgence of Republicanism in the Western world. Bobbitt argues that The Prince and the Discourses should be read as one book on the state (il stato). Instead of Machiavelli writing a “mirror of princes” work like his predecessors, Machiavelli is attempting something else. In The Prince Machiavelli aims to establish a practical ethics for establishing a state (principality). After the establishment of the state, Machiavelli recommends a transition to a republican form of government. Machiavelli undertakes this intellectual project in the hope that Italy will one day unify into a single state under a republican government, a hope that was not realized until several centuries after his death. In forwarding this argument, Bobbitt does not see Machiavelli as a teacher of evil, but as an astute student of political realities that is willing to weigh the consequences of action and not pay mere lip service to ethical guidelines that don't deal with the reality of those grasping for political power.I found Bobbitt's argument convincing. Most who read Machiavelli have to admit that he has insights into the behavior of those grasping or seeking power (i.e., all of us). His classic query is to whether it is better to be loved or to be hated, a question that has a practical ring to it for personal relations as much as for political rule. Many readers over the centuries have felt that in taking any advice from Machiavelli one was somehow lowering oneself in a dastardly way, but this is not (necessarily) so. Machiavelli tries to establish the guidelines for founding a state (or regime or scheme of power) that can be later transferred into a more stable republic.Bobbitt's argument about Machiavelli makes a lot of sense, but it also leaves many unanswered questions. The review of the book by Garry Wills in the New York Times suggest that Bobbitt’s book tacitly approves of a powerful state that will limit civil liberties and unduly aggrandize the regime. Wills seems to believe that Bobbitt’s argument grants license to the Dick Cheneys of the world to do as they will in protection of the state. I didn't read Bobbitt as making that argument, although I am curious to go back and look more closely at The Shield of Achilles and especially Terror and Consent to learn how Bobbitt draws these lines. Bobbitt does ignore the question of when Machiavelli’s ethics of The Prince should no longer apply. In other words, a newly formed principality, according to Machiavelli and Bobbitt, must work under different set of guidelines than an established republic. However, to what extent can a republic or should a republic revert to the ethics of a principality when under threat? Indeed, history seems littered with examples of political leaders who grasp for power when external forces threaten. The identification of an external threat is the oldest trick in the playbook for extending political power. According to Machiavelli and Bobbitt, how do we sort out the legitimate expediencies that Machiavelli might consider legitimate from those that would prove harmful to a republic? Our own republic has undergone a serious decline in civil liberties under the terrorist threats of the last 20 years, and before that, under the threat of communism. Despite the warnings of people like George Kennan, throughout the Cold War the US too often mimicked our adversaries in paranoia, state security, and limitations on freethinking. The same thing can be happening in the current age, although Al Qaeda and Islamic fundamentalism don’t pose the ideological threat that Marxism once held as an attractive messianic religion. For anyone who is remotely interested in Machiavelli and the world in which he lived and acted, I highly recommend Bobbitt's book. Bobbitt is not a Machiavelli scholar, but he has done his homework and marshaled his arguments in a way that is convincing and appealing. I hope his next book will address the application of Machiavelli and Machiavellian principles in today's world and how we can distinguish between the legitimate uses of power and their easy corruption.

Philip Bobbitt is best known for his earlier work ""The Shield of Achilles"", a thousand-page work tracing the development of the modern state. This book, ""The Garments of Court and Palace,"" focuses more narrowly on the inception of the modern state, through the prism of Machiavelli’s writings. At the same time it claims to be a new interpretation and synthesis of Machiavelli’s thought, rejecting many widely held beliefs about it, including that he denied the importance of virtue and morality in politics. Bobbitt posits that Machiavelli instead had a specific conception of virtue, and he wrote with a precise constitutional purpose: he was the midwife of the European princely state, superseding the feudal state, and therefore the herald of the modern Western state, in all its versions.The book’s title comes from Machiavelli’s famous 1513 letter, written during forced retirement, in which he describes his day, at the end of which he comes home, shakes off the dust of the countryside, dons “the garments of court and palace” and proceeds to immerse himself, through books, in the ancients and their lives, ‘jott[ing] down what I have profited from in their conversation.’ ” Bobbitt’s basic claim is that in his labors Machiavelli presciently identified a wholly new type of state struggling to be born and devoted his writings to bringing that form of state into existence. Though he failed in his immediate goal of enabling such a state in central and northern Italy, his writings influenced its later development outside of Italy. Bobbitt’s project is thus to deny the common view that Machiavelli was often self-contradictory or self-serving in his works, and to present him as a genius with a unitary vision of a new constitution of government. His primary method to show this is to rescue Machiavelli from the common habit of picking standalone passages from his works, and instead to synthesize all his commentary within the larger context it is made. I am not really qualified to judge if Bobbitt is correct in his conclusions, or for that matter in his analysis, but certainly he offers an impressive and cogent argument.Most of Bobbitt’s inquiry revolves around Machiavelli’s two best-known works, ""The Prince"" and ""Discourses on Livy,"" though others also come in, such as the ""Florentine Histories"" and ""The Art of War."" The first two are usually seen as contradicting each other, especially in that the first is seen as endorsing authoritarian or princely rule, and the second as endorsing republican rule. Bobbitt sees them instead as not inconsistent in any way, and in fact claims they should really be viewed as parts of one work, hypothetically named Lo Stato, “the state,” split into two as a result of events beyond Machiavelli’s control. Generally, I am not a fan of historians who search for, much less find, hidden meanings earlier missed, especially when those meanings fly in the face of common understandings and common sense (Paul Rahe, whom Bobbitt cites occasionally, is a prime offender, like many disciples of Leo Strauss). But Bobbitt doesn’t seem to take his analysis too far, and maintains a sense of detachment, so the effect isn’t too annoying.Stato is a word that Machiavelli often used, but to which he (sometimes) gave an entirely new meaning. In translations of Machiavelli, this appears to often be a bone of contention—what Machiavelli meant by a specific word, since he frequently used existing words by giving them new meanings, rather than coining neologisms. This also makes the task of readers of works analyzing Machiavelli difficult, since we must rely on filtering through experts, who disagree among themselves on many crucial matters. But there is no help for that, so I will treat Bobbitt’s argument as it stands. Along the same lines, a very great deal of Bobbitt’s analysis depends on careful parsing of dates, both of events in Machiavelli’s life, and in the history of Italy during that time. Since this is a short book, it is hard to tell, but it seems like portions of Bobbitt’s chronology are disputed, and there is a distinct feel that Bobbitt may be glossing over arguments in opposition. On the other hand, he is very open that his is a minority and novel view, and he cannot be expected to both set forth his argument and defend it against all possible attacks in a few hundred pages.Bobbitt lists five common understandings of Machiavelli’s work and explicitly rejects them all (though he nods to the apparent hubris of this, in defense quoting Isaiah Berlin, “where more than twenty interpretations hold the field, the addition of one more cannot be deemed an impertinence”). The most prominent of these understandings is that ""The Prince"" is a mirror book, a book of advice for rulers. From the belief that ""The Prince"" is a mirror book flows the most common criticism of Machiavelli, found early in reactions to his work (including in Shakespeare)—that he was an amoral villain who advised rejecting all virtue and morality, hence the adjective “Machiavellian.” Bobbitt’s repeatedly contrasts Machiavelli’s writings with Cicero’s ""De Oficiis,"" the classic mirror book, claiming that “expecting a mirror book, [Machiavelli’s] readers were given a mirror instead.” That is, ""The Prince"" is a book of analysis of the world as it is, and men as they are, not as it and they should be, as would be a traditional mirror book. Bobbitt instead posits that Machiavelli does not reject virtue, he merely defines it differently than classical sources like Cicero.Perhaps so, though the onion-layer type of morality Bobbitt offers instead, on Machiavelli’s behalf, is so far removed from what Cicero was talking about that it’s not really the same type of morality at all. Bobbitt’s key claim, one which he appears to also have made in his other books, is that Machiavelli was a believer in “consequentialism”—the idea, in short, that the moral demands placed on a political leader are inherently not comparable to the moral demands placed on an individual. Or, put more bluntly, a leader sometimes acts in a wholly moral fashion when he does things that for an individual would be evil. This is because the state, lo stato, properly viewed, is not, or should no longer be, regarded as synonymous with the prince himself—the ruler acts on behalf of his people, which may require acting in a way forbidden to an autonomous individual. What this boils down to is an argument from necessity—when the state must be protected, the ruler must do what is necessary, and he does not act wrongly by torturing, killing, or lying to do so. “Properly viewed” here means a new kind of state, the state aborning, where the state is not horizontally and vertically enmeshed within a feudal web, but rather a modern unitary and autonomous state—still led by a prince, but fundamentally different than earlier states. This insight is what Bobbitt credits as Machiavelli’s supreme achievement—prescience, and theoretical application of that prescience to the circumstances at hand in his lifetime. On this reading, Machiavelli is not separating ethics from politics at all. He is offering a mirror book, just with a different type of mirror.Bobbitt’s moral imperative of consequentialism therefore revolves around what constitutes the “common good.” Not all evil actions of the ruler are excused by consequentialism—those that are not in furtherance of the common good are still immoral. Excessive cruelty, such as that of the Syracusan tyrant Agathocles, is not justified by appeals to the common good, nor are such acts as torture if done for personal gratification. Bobbitt wrote a book on the War on Terror; I have not read it, but on this reasoning presumably he excuses waterboarding of terrorists but not the petty humiliations of Abu Ghraib. Trying to fit this into a traditional moral frame, Bobbitt argues, weakly, that “Machiavelli’s argument . . . is grounded in a Christian view of reality,” and that “Roughly speaking, Machiavelli’s ethics recognize that different forms of life require different ethical rules.” I’m not sure this is all that different from the traditional knock on Machiavelli as a preacher of vice, though; it’s just phrased differently, in the language of utilitarianism given a moral gloss. Bobbitt doesn’t understand Christian views at any level, since his argument is because bad people are everywhere, as shown in Genesis, “it is a prudent rule that the prince who governs a state must do unto others as they would do unto him,” because otherwise the downfall of the state will result, and people for whom the prince is responsible will suffer. This may be true, but it is very dubiously Christian (for which “prudence” is not the main judge of what is moral), as shown by both Machiavelli’s and Bobbitt’s exclusive reliance on Old Testament examples to buttress their claims, and Bobbitt makes no other effort, beyond the bald claim, to show that it is Christian. He would do better to examine the rule of Charlemagne to grasp the tensions that devout Christianity imposes on a ruler—although, to be fair, Bobbitt’s point seems to be that the new, princely form of the state is inherently different than the feudal one of Charlemagne. Still, maybe the Saxons could be slaughtered in a way found compatible with Christianity, but it’s harder to see why all your Borgia or Medici brothers-in-law need to get knifed. Necessity has never been regarded in Christian thought as the “get out of jail free” card that Bobbitt seems to think it is.Of course, Machiavelli was right, in that it is true that consequentialism is the governing principle of all modern states. On a secular level, certainly, consequentialism seems appealing, but it strays very close to “the end justifies the means” (something Machiavelli never said, as Bobbitt is at pains to point out), which removes the ruler’s decisions entirely from the moral realm. This makes it a favorite argument of embattled rulers—both princely, but even more of republican rulers, who are trying to justify to the masses and to history what they feel they must do. Lincoln, famously, used consequentialist arguments in his remaking of the American state. So, perhaps, as a description of reality, Machiavelli was entirely correct—though given his influence, what is chicken, and what is egg?For Bobbitt, therefore, none of Machiavelli’s books are princely instruction, even though they are addressed and dedicated to princes. They are constitutional treatises directed to society at large. The Prince is, in this view, really a sub-part of a larger work, the hypothetical Lo Stato, entirely on republics, “which proposes an ethics of service to the state.” But ""The Prince"" was hurriedly extracted out of the larger work as a result of very specific happenings of the time, when due to Medici accession to the Papacy “[Machiavelli] saw an opportunity to create a new principality in the centre of Italy, uniting Rome and the papal vicarages [lords putatively enfeudated to the Pope] with Florence and its possessions, and thus providing a bulwark against Spain and France.” Machiavelli is therefore said to have seen that the new order of things, of states in the era of gunpowder warfare (Bobbitt is very focused on warfare in all his books), long distance communications, bureaucracy, and increasing wealth, needed a new constitutional order to respond to new strategic imperatives—the princely, as opposed to the feudal state. In the nature of the way things were at that time and place, this would be a state headed by a monarch, hence the immediate focus on princely rule in ""The Prince"" (especially on a ruler who lacked long-term legitimacy, a “new prince”), but Bobbitt’s thesis is that Machiavelli wished to demonstrate overall, in Lo Stato, that this princely state was a transition phase to a new form of republican state—one which would have as its chief goal the promotion of the common good.Bobbitt claims that Machiavelli believed that a non-republican princely state was too inflexible to survive long; when Fortuna arrived bearing changed circumstances, individual men would find it very hard to change with the times (a perennial Machiavelli theme), but a republic could bring forward new, suitable men at need. Machiavelli also supposedly believed that many rules he pushed, such as that past good deeds not excuse punishment for later bad deeds, were incompatible with autocratic rule, though why that should be is not clear. In fact, much of this seems to be grasping to put the best gloss on republican government, because for every supposed virtue of republics, a virtue of authoritarian governments could be adduced—for example, authoritarian governments more often avoid the fickleness and inconstancy of republics, especially those with a broad franchise. Bobbitt, however, does not address such lines of thought, although he does note that Machiavelli believed the vices of the masses could be channeled and constrained by proper civil and constitutional structures, a far more plausible hope in 1513 than in 2018 (not to mention that Machiavelli had zero interest in democracy). Moreover, Bobbitt several times falls into the basic error of believing that the rule of law is somehow a consequence of, or dependent on, a non-authoritarian form of government, something that is ludicrous both historically and theoretically if given a moment’s thought.To examine this more closely, people can agree that the common good should be the highest aim of the state. But why should a republic serve this goal best? For Bobbitt’s Machiavelli, it is because the republican form ultimately conveys both legitimacy and durability, in a way that the princely state cannot. That evades the question, since a longer-lasting state does not necessarily best serve the common good, unless that good is reduced to mere stability. This is a question that has new resonance today, as “liberal democracy” reaches its end. Not that Bobbitt foresaw that end—in fact, in all his books, including this one, he vigorously pushes his idea that we have now moved beyond both the type of then-modern state envisioned by Machiavelli, and its successors (such as the twentieth-century “industrial nation-state”) to a new form, the “market state,” by which Bobbitt means not free markets, but (though he phrases it, and views it, more positively) the neoliberal state that exalts unfettered autonomy and unbridled consumerism under the tutelage and whip of an overweening government. You would think that Bobbitt would notice the inherent contradictions and spreading cracks in this Leviathan with feet of clay, with its lassitude, discontented loneliness and linked lack of children and future, but you would be mostly wrong, although he does suggest that “the sense of a single polity, held together by adherence to fundamental values, is not a sense that is cultivated by the market state,” and intimates that is a bad thing. What Machiavelli would think of all this, he does not say, but my bet is that he would change his mind about the inherent superiority of republics.So this book is interesting, though hardly earthshattering. Every so often a false note creeps in. No, “a specific provision of the United States Constitution” does not forbid the suspension of habeas corpus—on the contrary, Article I, Section 9 explicitly authorizes such suspension, although whether by Congress or the President is unclear. And Bobbitt is a lawyer, or at least a law professor, and so elevates men like him above the rest, claiming that dislike for Machiavelli is partially driven by brutish dislike for our betters, who are people like him. He cites “our [read: not my] current contempt for bureaucrats, for politicians, for lawyers—the superstitious reaction of people who are frightened by forces they identify with those who are trying to master those forces, rather like blaming a volcanologist for a volcanic eruption.” Um—sure, Philip. Bureaucrats and lawyers are just like Superman. Still, the book flows well, and Bobbitt provides a very helpful chronology, notes, and bibliography for those interested in diving deeper. You can do worse than start here to think about Machiavelli.

The book is a tough read. The first half made me want to put it down without finishing it. At around the 90th page (of about a total of 160), it turned around. The argument could get circular and repetitive even after that point but the final chapter is a marvel. In a little over 10 pages the author provides an assessment of the current political climate in the Western world that is remarkably astute and clear minded.

Great examination of Machiavelli's political philosophy and the humanist, republican views he espoused. It's a great explanation of why his vision is so often twisted and misappropriated by over-simplifying and opportunistic hacks who dominate contemporary politics.

Bobbitt's thesis is provocative and his writing is, as always, engaging. Even so, his attempt to reconcile ""The Prince"" with ""Discourses on Livy"" may be too clever by half. The last chapter, which barely fits into the rest of this short book, is a poor man's version of Bobbitt's ""Shield of Achilles.""

This is a great read. Bobbitt is a clear thinker and observant analyst of historical trends and nuanced political philosophy. This book re-examines Machiavelli's ethical and moral stance and his foresight in recognizing the emergence of the state as we know it today. An eye-opening and very thought-provoking read. I enjoyed it immensely for the clarity of argument and the shifting of paradigm.

This is a smart book that turns over many preconceptions about Machiavelli. It places his theories firmly in the camp of constitutional scholarship, and combines his two works -- often seen as too distinct -- into one The State. Recommended.
