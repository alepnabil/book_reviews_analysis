0,Reece,"It is boring, often incoherent (which I am learning is a theme of Aristotle's works as I trudge through the equally meandering 'Nicomachean Ethics'), and serves to better historically gauge political theory of antiquity and political structure of antiquity than to actually translate relevant ideas to the modern reader. Defenses of patriarchal structure, slavery, and the like are some of the foundational arguments lied down in the book; it also leads from the NE's position on what eudaimonia is and how it can be achieved, with respect to achieving this in a political city-state. This is problematic (for me) because Aristotle's arguments in 'Nicomachean Ethics' wind around countless presumptions, contradictions, and pretensions. This means that my foundation for 'Politics' already sucks and leaves the entering reader cynical, that is, if they critically read through the Ethics. His dogma is irritating to no end to boot.I also don't care much about the discourse surrounding the original texts being lecture notes vs actual books, etc, when reviewing this. I take it into context, but context does not necessarily dictate quality for me. It is frustrating, boring, and ridiculous. But at least you have read another Aristotle book and are that much closer to being in on the ""great conversation"" of philosophy, or whatever some pretensious university cuck might call it.I recommend passing by this shitshow. There are a lot of greater books to read, and better ways to spend your time.

1,Toby,"The Politics is on the face of it a sequel to the Nichomachean ethics - at least the final chapter of the latter work sets up the Politics as the ethical outworking of Aristotle's philosophy. The Politics is not such a neat work as Ethics, tailing off slightly unsatisfactorily with a discussion about the place of music in education and spending rather too long examining different kinds of ancient Greek constitution. Even so, it rightly sits at along with Plato's Republic as the cornerstone of Western political thinking.Reading this made me wonder what Aristotle would make of Twenty-First Century British politics. Broadly, British political life fits in with his idea of a democratic-oligarchic mix with the people having a vote but the ""governing class"" effectively making laws. I think that he would be appalled at the idea of a referendum - probably rightly so given the poor quality of the debate over the EU - and he would have been disturbed at the growing inequality in society which he felt pulled societies apart.His comments on education seem rather more to the point. When discussing the place of art in education: both for an appreciation of beauty and for commercial advantage he notes ""to be constantly asking 'what use is it?' is unbecoming to those of great soul (megalopsuchos) and unworthy of free men."" May the government take note.

2,Hershel Shipman,"Well this is a fundamental political/philosophy book. Aristotle is equivalently wrong on several accounts but on many others I find myself agreeing with him.Some of the things I found to be wrong are: Some people being more slavie than others. Women being unequal to men, his idea's that the Greeks were superior to everyone around them, and his utter fascination with monarchies. However, some of this comments on how the best possible scenario for a state is to have a middle class larger than either its upper or lower were spot on. His comments on having a varied and liberal education as being important to being a good citizen applies today. His view that music should be one of the foundational parts of a person's education is one I agree with in totality. Also the fact that being a good citizen and a good person have little to do with each other.I will probably reread this book again after I devour more philosophy, history, and ancient Greek literature.Also Aristotle should have avoided doing any amount of writings on science. He failed horrible, thought of it as a though experiment and in generial, his ideas, along with Ptolemy's caused many hurdles in advancement of knowledge, but I should leave this rant for another of his books...

3,Al Maki,"Reading it I was struck that he was talking about a world in which the ultimate authorities over your life not only had faces that you yourself saw regularly, perhaps daily but might even be you yourself! No “market forces” no “movements”: no “experts” but people you knew and spoke to. It’s strange that I find that strange, yet having been through a national election only three days ago, I find his assumption completely foreign. Of the people I know I’m the only one who actually spoke with a candidate, we’re all too busy doing more important things than governing ourselves!In his world it made sense to think the purpose of government is to create a venue in which people can act personally to lead a good life and that for government to do otherwise would be perverse. So unfortunately, I don’t find him applicable to the world I find myself in.As to the style, I found it too succinct to be convincing, too much a catalogue. His logic could be very good at times but often relied on unstated assumptions from a world long gone.

4,Reem,"Now this completely lovely book was studied in the first course of Political Theory.. Imagine how much would it be enjoyable & hard to study that course. You never understand the purpose of the author from reading it one time , that is the problem with old texts.After you read it many times and the professor explains it to you , slowly it becomes enjoyable ! It tells you a lot of things about Aristotle and even Plato.. Those guys were really obsessed with making similarities between medicine and political science , was that good ? maybe yes or maybe no . Them talking about medicine gives you the feeling of the dilemma of having social sciences like natural sciences ; this was actually the reason of behaviorism eruption they said social sciences must follow the fellow natural sciences ! That was a tricky thing since Classical political sciences stand against behaviorists .. I don't know how many stars to give to the book , maybe time will tell but I surely enjoyed it in the second time .. Second times do make difference

5,Phillip,"I read excerpts from this text pursuant to my dissertation. It's amazing how relevant and interesting political philosophy from the 4th century BCE can be to modern ways of thinking and understanding the world democratically. One of the main things I take from this is that the running of the polis--the body politic--is much more tied to property ownership in Aristotle's philosophy than I would like it to be, but that what characterized democracy is precisely the liberty from being ruled by those with property. Of course, today with our 'representative democracy' in the United States of Citizens United, we have a functional oligarchy, in which those with the most money to contribute to campaigns win the elections through their chosen representatives. This is, for Aristotle, probably not a democracy. It would be better if those who served in currently elected offices were not elected by a vote, but chosen by lot, as they did in ancient Athens. This would eliminate the influence of money from politics.

6,Ci,"Book 1: 8/2016. According to the recommendation from the wisemen of ""Great Books"" series, I read the Book I in one setting. Following the first two books of Plato's Republic, Aristotle's ""Politics"" has a clean, fresh, brisk directness. (Platonic dialogues are good and well, but staying in the conversations too long may overwhelm one's attention and patience. ""What is the conclusion?"" The modern infant in me cried out -- naturally with apologies.)Aristotle developed his thoughts on Politics through the starting point of ""good and honorable life"". In his view, politics and government are indispensable for human to achieve such life. From household management of persons and property, Aristotle laid out a structural framework for divisions of labor, master and slave, male and female, art of war, property and wealth-getting, money and exchange commerce. What he considered ""just"" and ""good"" may shock modern sensibility, however one must remember that Aristotelian thoughts are among the deep roots of human society.

7,Jenna,"What I would say is its the most authoritative and lasting textbook of political history. The explaination on how to annul revolution and causes of corruption in different states and the means of preserving it was vividly stated by Aristotle, and it would gives you an idea why governments failure happened.It also provides the analysis on political states that existed during 384-322 BC. and its moral perspective, and well-being of the states morally and politically. Aristotle's on his own words said that: No bounds to riches can be fixed for man's thy be gifted as in other arts; for the instrument of no art whatsoever are infinite, either in their number or their magnitude; but riches are a number of instruments in domestic and civil economy; it is therefore evident that the acquisition of cetain things according to nature is a part of both domestic and civil economy, and for what reason.

8,Julia,"i have to apologize for what i wrote earlier about the republic. the republic was great. i did not realize how great plato was until i read aristotle and discovered i VASTLY prefer plato's writing style. but like even this isn't as negative and vociferous as it would have been before, because since finishing politics (which i didn't find terribly engaging, enough that i wrote my second sosc paper on the republic instead of politics) we have read AQUINAS and his style is The Worst. also i've spent a lot of time unintentionally viewing the world through ideas espoused in the republic but have thought little about what was said in politics, which is a Sign of Something, i suppose. so obviously the best parts of politics are when aristotle fights it out with stuff he read in the republic. i should also add i liked politics more than the excerpts of the nicomachean ethics we read. the voluntary struggle with dead white men continues.

9,Nicko,"It's a little bit of hard work, given that lack of consistent flow of arguments through the book. I found the first part of the book on systems of government / constitutions to be circumlocutory and circular in argument.But the beauty of Aristotle, like other wisdom written 2000 odd years ago is it applicability to today - human nature doesn't change.Some aspects are more surprising than others: his arguments for men marrying women 20 years their junior were piss-funny; I'll cite Aristotle when I choose to leave my wife for a younger model.Aristotle's thesis for what to teach for a child's education is gold - could be straight out of the curriculum debates/wars of today.Interesting to find that Aristotle writes about all forms of government being bad; but democracy being the worst of these - an expression often quoted to Churchill, albeit not his original expression (now I know).

10,Maria,"Politics! The state! Democracy!Aristotle's words, much like Plato's in The Republic is sure to haunt me forever. As a keen democrat (yes, with a small ""d"") and as a citizen of a democratic country, it is truly interesting to see the roots of democracy and how our philosophical fathers thought about it. In Lincoln's words, ""The government for the people, by the people, and of the people,"" does not sound well with Aristotle, but it sure does sound well with me.It is more interesting to me, however, on the essence of the city-state itself and how Greek life involved around it. Even more so, our philosophical fathers' silence on slavery, which may have attributed to slavery's rice in the later centuries.If I were to write a thorough review of Politics it would take me much more time, probably because I took this book seriously. I read it almost as a person would study the roots of a tree to understand how it grows.

11,Zo ,"Tried a re-read, only got through about half. Got some stuff out of it I wouldn't have if I hadn't read Plato beforehand, but largely still felt like the same repetitive ethnography of different political systems of his period with scattered interesting philosophical propositions (i.e. man as political animal) interspersed. I found it more productive/interesting reading the Stanford entry than the text itself, which is likely a combination of his turgid style and my own lack of understanding. I think if I were to read more Aristotle I should check out Nicomachean Ethics or Metaphysics since they are more ""purely"" philosophy. The Stanford entry has convinced me that coming to greater understanding of Aristotle has lots of philosophical utility, and I also can tell there are a number of ongoing interesting hermeneutical debates, but I think I need to either take Aristotle in a class or read him with secondary literature to get much out of it.

12,Philip,"Many readers dislike the pre-Christian tendencies in this work regarding subjects like slavery and women, but it must be admitted that this was a product of its era. And we are a product of our era (which has in no little part been influenced by Christian notions of fundamental human equality). Yet for such great distinction in eras, Aristotle offers us a remarkable discussion of enduring issues of populism and aristocracy, rule of all versus rule of some, and so on. I found a number of the insights, while dated, impressively relevant to our circumstance today. Aristotle saw some of the issues of democracy and oligarchy much clearer then than we do now. Perhaps because of the fog of the current two-party system we fail to understand the common sense of what influenced the founding of our nation so many years ago.

13,Mike,"I flew through this book way faster than one should expect for a 1,000 page book. But that is not a good thing in this case. The reason is that I felt like I was reading in circles, so I started to breeze over parts that seemed to simply restate the things he was saying in pages and even chapters prior. Add that repetitive tone to the fact that it was centered around 2,500 year old sociopolitical philosophy.I mean, shame on me, I knew what I was getting into. Perhaps I shouldn't be critical about this book. Maybe I just got into a too-dense book that was about a too-sense topic that has no bearing on my life. I'm sure Aristotle will retain his reputation as a great thinker without my stamp of approval. For that, it wouldn't be right for me to rate it, so I give the big guy a no star review here.

14,Mohamed Abdelghany,"Politics is a political science book. It concentrates on the political history and behavior of the Greeks up to Aristotle's time. Nonetheless it doesn't offer a clear view of Aristotle's opinions and views; the way the book was written is very confusing it is keeps repeating the same ideas over and over, it also promises explanations and never fulfills. In the introduction the editor suggests that this might be a draft that Aristotle never finished.The ideas within the book are outdated and flawed. Aristotle's opinions on women, slavery, social structure are very offensive by our modern standards. However the book offers a good view to how ancient Greeks used to think politically. It is more interesting from a historical point of view than from a philosophical point of view.

Aristotle seems very interested in arguing about the realities of politics (perhaps compared to Plato or Socrates, whose works he criticizes at several points). This is a dense, slow read, not so much because the words are difficult, or even the language, but because the logic is so thoroughly examined that it can become easy to be bogged down in the structure, such that you forget what the overall thrust of a particular paragraph is supposed to be. I found the sections on education most interesting, but there is a lot to cover here.

19,Zach,"Aristotle is, unsurprisingly, comprehensive and relatively close to inventing political philosophy in the west (it should be noted that I haven't read The Republic or The Laws yet). With that said, there are some definite caveats to Politics. One is that Aristotle, brilliant though he is, can hardly conceive of anything other than a city-state as a form of government. He treats the concept with characteristic thoroughness, of course, but he's stuck in that idea. Another is that his quick (and depressing) ability to rattle off revolutions shows the tenuousness by which Greek governments were formed; this is a serious issue he is trying to solve (and one that would eventually be solved forcibly for the Greeks by Philip).

Anyway, I ever reread it when I'm older, I might be in a better place to grasp my thoughts and transfer them into a ""review"". I'm quoting it, because can anyone really review works like this?

24,George Sim,"A natural continuance of the Ethics, Aristotle describes all kinds of political systems, the character of the state, the character of the citizen. He gives suggestions on how the state should be organized and what is the end of the state. The fact that much of his work has been lost, makes the book incomplete and the work unfinished. So, the reader is not shown any conclusions to Aristotle's contemplation. Politics could be related to Plato's The Republic in some aspects, although Aristotle many times criticizes his mentor and his sayings in similar matters. Overall, an interesting book with many insights on political systems of the ancient world, but with limited conclusive context.

So my three stars are for the extent to which this text still offers value to our thinking about how to live a good life. Important and worthwhile insights remain here, especially about the need for balance and proportion in a state, but there is much in here also that has just not stood the test of time.
