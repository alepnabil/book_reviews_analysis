0,Matt,"As Plato’s writings have been a cornerstone of Western thought, so have those of his pupil Aristotle through his own lectures and treatise sometimes agreed and disagreed with his teacher while shaping the views of millions over the millennia. Politics is one of the most important political treatise that has impacted society as it is studied alongside Plato’s own Republic not because they agree, but how they agree through different methods and disagree in conclusions.Unlike the approach of Plato, Aristotle focused on the examples that the Greek political world knew of to determine the best approach for government of a polis. Classifying the types of government into six forms, three “ideal” and three “perverted”, Aristotle described them as showing their pros and cons in an effort to establish the “best”. Then his analysis turned to various functions of government from laws, offices, and how to pass or fill either. Yet, underlying everything is Aristotle’s insistence that human nature determines everything concerned with governance.Politics, while thought-provoking and significant in its analysis and conclusions, is unfortunately not without its flaws. The biggest is Aristotle’s argument of natural rulers and natural slaves that is so opposite to the way many think today. The next biggest is that fact that the overall work seems like it is not coherently organized or even complete as many aspects that Aristotle says he will cover never appear and he writes about the bringing about his conclusive best government before actually proving what it is, though given his argument that the best government for a polis depends on how its population is constructed.Aristotle’s Politics is at the same both thought-provoking and maddening especially given the soundness of his analysis and the disorganized state of the overall treatise. Yet it is one of the most important treatises of political thought of the Western world and is significant in political and historical terms as it has been influential for millennia.

1,Laila,"It's rather silly to be critical on Aristotle's views on slavery, women, virtues and such; he was merely reflecting the culture and the setting of his time. Sadly, while slavery had been abolished or criminalized in most part of the world, nevertheless modern slavery still exist. Meaning we as human race still don't get it that enslaving fellow human beings for whatever reason is wrong.I agree with Aristotle that democracy while not the best form of governance is far better than the alternatives--monarchy or tyranny (I would add anarchism). Similarly, capitalism while not the best economics system is far better than the alternative--socialism.An interesting take from Aristotle in this book is that in order to stabilize the relationship between the rich and the poor classes (that always mistrust of each other) is to keep theses two classes small and in turn to create a larger middle class as a buffer thus lessen the tension among classes. What a clever bugger, Aristotle was to think of that.

4,Galicius,"Book ICommunities and states are established to bring the greatest good to its members. Qualifications of a king and master or householder are not the same as some (Plato) think. It’s not just the number of subjects they have to deal with. A statesman is also different and he rules when citizens set up a government and rule by political science. But there are different kinds of rule.Aristotle goes no to consider the relationship between master and slave, absolute and relative meaning of the terms. He questions whether slavery is indeed natural and compares warfare to hunting of wild animals. He points out that the Greeks consider themselves free men everywhere but don’t consider barbarians the same way. Barbarians are only free in their own land. He begins consideration of property and wealth getting both that which is necessary like obtaining food and managing household and the unnecessary type like unlimited gathering of coin or other property. Men confuse their goal of living well which has a limit of how much wealth it requires with that by which they become absorbed with acquiring wealth and property and loose sight of their original aim. Their desire becomes unlimited and unnecessary. There is a natural way of gathering wealth from fruits and animals or land or sea. The other way or retail trade is not natural. The “most hated sort” is usury which makes money out of money itself—“of all modes of getting wealth this is the most unnatural”.Theorizing about wealth getting may be worthy of philosophy but in practice such discussion may be irksome.There are three occupations in wealth getting: husbandry and farming; exchange, commerce, usury; mining.Aristotle gives two examples of financial speculation where one man created a monopoly of wine presses, and another a monopoly in iron. A husband and father rules over his wife and children, and as master over his slaves. “For although there may be exceptions to the order of nature the male is fitter to command than the female, just as the elder…to the younger and more immature.Aristotle raises the question whether there is any excellence and virtue in a slaves and women. If they “share in rational principle” it’s absurd to think they have one and should be ruled instead of ruling also.The ruler too can be unjust, cowardly and will not rule well. Both the ruler and subject have virtue but varying. Socrates said, “the temperance of a man and of a woman…are not the same…or the courage and justice”. All classes have their “special attributes”. He quotes Sophocles from Ajax: “Silence is a woman’s glory”. Masters should be a “source…of excellence” to the slave and not employ command only.The virtues of a family are supposed to make a difference in the virtue of the state. Aristotle will “examine the various theories of the perfect state” next.

5,Atratzu Talgala,"Why I wanted this book:I consider myself something of a slight armchair philosopher. I heard enough philosophy growing up that I definitely agree that the “unexamined life is not worth living.” I’ve combed the internet for free resources and checked out various lectures online. As an armchair philosopher I thought it kind of funny I didn’t even own any philosophy books… not proper philosophical-thought-books anyway, because naturally there are philosophies in the background of all that we say, do, see, read, etc.So I wanted to take the next step and pick up a philosophy book. Where better to start then the Ancient Greeks? I’m fairly familiar with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle and that they are sometimes considered the foundation for western thought. However I’m not entirely certain this was the best book to start with, and would probably be better suited to read in a scholastic setting where questions would be asked during a lecture or after reading a section and there was a teacher specializing in ancient greek culture on hand.All that to say I got in over my head with this book. I’m not going to pretend that “ah yes, this book is rich and finely decorated” much like the emperor’s clothes. I struggled paying attention while I was reading and tried different methods to keep my attention on what I was reading. (A friend suggested I keep notes in a notebook, so that’s what I did and worked the best.)I’ll do my best to articulate my opinion on this book… but I’m afraid I have trouble recounting what I actually read. I have a notebook full of notes from 1313a11 to 1342b7. But without those notes I could tell you nothing about what I read just days after reading it. Again… I’m not sure what that says about me, the book, the translation, or something else.Bekker Numbers (I don’t understand them)First I would like to explain a detail about how this book is organized that I never really figured out: There are Eight “Chapters” in this book and they’re called “Books” for some reason. I don’t know why they’re called books instead of chapters, I suspect this has something to do with translation from greek… It might also be because the topic changes, but not until you’ve worked your way into that chapter. Oftentimes I found the thought continuing from chapter to chapter… Again, I found the organizational method very puzzling and distracting.The book is also organized by some set of numbers and letters which are related to the translation, called “Bekker Numbers” I’m sure all of that was very interesting and useful for people properly studying this manuscript and contrasting it with the original greek manuscript, but it just confused me as a casual reader... Especially since the book starts at 1252a1. Presumably meaning Politics by Aristotle starts at “page1252, left column, first line”.General statements about the book:There’s a lot of ideology that Aristotle had on governments and how the they should be run that just really doesn’t make any sense to me and might be best explained by an expert on the subject; Children raised by the state, the different classes (Husbandmen, Artisans, Gaurdians, etc), slavery, and more.However just as there are some confusing and appalling topics there is a lot of progressive thought that you can see influenced today's society. In particular I think of the general question “What is the purpose of government” and Aristotle's answer in book 7 (1328b8) “Let us enumerate the functions of a state, and we shall easily elicit what we want: first, there must be food; secondly, arts for life requires many instruments; thirdly, there must be arms, for the members of a community have need of them, and in their own hands, too, in order to maintain authority both against disobedient subjects and against external assailants; fourthly, there must be a certain amount of revenue, both for internal needs, and for purpose of war; fifthly, or rather first, there must be a care of religion, which is commonly called worship; sixthly, and most necessary of all, there must be a power of deciding what is for the public interest, and what is just in men’s dealings with one another”.It sure makes “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness” in the united states declaration of independence seem so much more succinct, doesn’t it?Honestly I feel like it’s difficult to talk about Politics by Aristotle because it’s such an incredible collection of ideas and thoughts that to do it justice you need to spend a lot of time discussing each book individually… Aristotle covers: What is a government/state? What form does politics take? The types of governments, what governments are good, what governments are bad,responses to governments from other city-states in the area, Education, public education, should children learn music? Aristotle uses analogies and comparisons to mathematics/geometry, and even musical modes “Dorrian is the manliest mode” according to Aristotle at 1342b7.I’m tempted to try to break each chapter into a topic and theme… but that’s very challenging for some sections of the book. Sometimes it feels like I’m reading a lecture, other times it feels like I’m reading the ranting of an old man, still other times I can understand why people are mesmerized by Aristotle's teachings. I feel like I ran the gauntlet of opinions throughout this book.Conclusion:So, I’ve said a lot of words about this book… what’s my conclusion? My final thoughts?I think that this book is an excellent collection of ideas. Some, I like. Some, I dislike. My experience with philosophy has always been a mixed bag of opinions and ideas that I agree with and disagree with. The value in philosophy for me is learning why I think what I think and being able to articulate that accurately and discuss it respectfully.So I pose more of these types of questions to myself: Did I learn anything? Was I exposed to new ideas? Was there value in reading Aristotle (outside of any worthless self-esteem “bragging rights”)? Easy answer: Yes.HOWEVER, I think I will need to return to this book someday and review it. I don’t think I have a strong enough foundation for my study of philosophy to properly appreciate all that is being discussed in this book. Again, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m not really understanding some of the key themes and topics addressed in this book, but I’m sure I’ll eventually crack it back open and try again.That’s the wonderful thing about learning and knowledge… it builds on itself. You need to learn basic mathematics before you try Geometry or Algebra. Politics by Aristotle might have been a bit too far of a jump for my current understanding but you’ll never know how you stack up unless you try. Besides, Aristotle can’t come get me and yell at me for not really understanding his writings very well. ...Just don’t tell his fans about me.

But, if all communities aim at some good, the state or political community, which is the highest of all, and which embraces all the rest, aims, and in a greater degree than any other, at the highest good."" from Book I I read this book for one of my political science classes and it marks my introduction to Aristotle. I have to say that despite his technical, opaque language it was a very good very informative read on how and why politics is created. This book is not as difficult as I thought it would be but it is not the warming receptive narrative of Plato. I won't go into detailed breakdown of every part of this treatise but the important points. The first point is that humans are political animals by nature because we have he ability for (sophisticated) speech and reason. The second thing is the idea of there being ""good"" forms of government and ""bad"" forms of government. The ""good"" forms of government are monarchy, aristocracy, and constitutional/polity. The ""bad"" forms of government are tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy. He spends a lot of time detailing different forms and examples of all of these types of government. For this project Aristotle spent years gathering information and surveying many all of the city-states in Greece and the ""barbarian"" countries outside of Greece. Despite living around Athens he believes Sparta (aristocracy) to be the best administered state in the Hellas. This was one of the most ambitious political science research projects in history to that point and it deserves the honor that it gets.

7,Maria," Aristotle, as well as Plato, holds that individuals aren't but part of a community, does not give rise to women in public, comparing them with slaves. Justifying slavery with nature, justifying all social malaise, responding to an anti democratic way of thinking, hence the need to say who is a citizen and who is not. Author atrocious, proving the insanity of the times before Christ, and the urgent need to revise more democratic and fairer systems. it's very clear how classical authors tends to think the politics in an organic way, understanding society as if it was a body, where each part has a specific funcion, where the whole precedes the parts, and the city is prior to man. Interesting book, not very clear if you don't read Plato before, and if you don't complements with classic contractualists after, the importance lies in getting the complete idea.

9,Xander,"Meant to serve as Part 2 in a lecture course, Politica is Aristotle's treatment of the State. As with everything he wrote and taught, the fundamental notion is his hylemorphism - the doctrine that everything consists of matter and form, and combined they serve some purpose or goal. The state consists of its citizens, as well as slaves and non-citizens (women, foreigners, etc.), and its form is the particular regime that orders society - i.e. its structure, institutions, laws and basically its power distribution. A citizen is someone who is able to rule and to be ruled, requiring a liberal education and hence leisure time to cultivate this virtuous disposition. As with everything Aristotle wrote, Politica is occupied with endless distinctions and differentiations. For example, Aristotle distinguishes six types of regime, based on the rule of one, some and many and the corruption or benefit of the political order. The good regimes are monarchy, aristocracy and polity; the bad ones are tyranny, oligarchy and democracy. While acknowledging that the best regime is a monarchy with an englightened despot (a 'pan basilea'), Aristotle also acknowledges that this type of regime is practically unrealistic - even if its instituted it is inherently stable due to factions waiting for a power grab. According to Aristotle, the most common types of regime are oligarchy and democracy - the rule of the rich and the rule of the power. The former leads to domination by those who own property, concluding that since some inequality exists, everything should be unequal. The latter leads to domination by those who are poor and destitute, who pander to demagogues, and conclude that since some equality exists, everything should be equal. As with the ideal state (i.e. the rule of an enlightened despot) factions are inevitable - different groups are on the hunt for offices that contain power and honour. In both types of regime the people and the elites are grabbing for power. Which leads Aristotle to claim that the best possible type of regime is one that combines oligarchy and democracy. The statesman should formulate laws that balance the power between the different factions, while the rulers should educate themselves in practical wisdom (phronesis), i.e. learning to distinguish, judge and act in the best interest of the community as a whole.This last remark is important. Aristotle sees the polity as an entity in itself, with its own purpose: the happiness (eudaimonia) of its citizens. This means that individual freedom is only secondary - the statesman should always keep the common good in his view.As a matter of fact, the whole Politica is sort of a handbook for the statesman. It oultines how he should govern and ensure that peace and stability are kept. Aristotle studies historical and contemporary societies to find the different types of constitutions, their peculiar strengths and weaknesses, and the particular dangers that threaten each type of regime. This is all done so that the statesman always knows how to respond appropriately to a situation. In the event of internal or external chaos, his goal is the speedy normalization of society, and here he is allowed to set traditions and laws aside. Aristotle recognizes the dangers of this: it breaks instituted habits and leads the people to openness to other ways of living. Yet context matters and sometimes the statesman needs room to manoeuvre in order to deal with threats. This makes Aristotle a relativistic conventionalist, in the sense that he both recognizes the multiplicity of possibilities for states to exist as well as the need to adhere to instituted traditions. (This, by the way, goes deeply against doctrines of later thinkers, like Hobbes, Weber, Machiavelli and Schmidt, who depart from extreme situations, like civil war, in order to build their theories of statesmanship. Aristotle departs from the stable normal situation, views conflicts as departures from convention, and sees the normalization as final goal.)The Politica is an interesting book, yet it is not well-structured and one feels very lost when diving into it. There is not a good strategy to read it - the book consists of endless referrals to earlier or later portions and the sequence of topics feels random at times. The most interesting parts (for me) were Aristotle's analyses of contemporary societies, in which he outlines all kinds of events and their underlying patterns. So this makes this book both a guide to obtain practical wisdom (as a statesman) as a historical source of ancient societies and customs. (Leaving aside how reliable Aristotle's sources and how non-partisan his descriptions were).It is an interesting book, especially after reading Ethica Nicomachea - there is some overlap between both works and some extension of prior topics - but I doubt if the Politica would spark some interest in the average modern reader.

10,Frank Stein,"This book reminds me of why I remain a modernist. The so-called classics do contain nuggets of wisdom, but the good parts have often already been incorporated in our thought, and the extraneous parts, of which there are many, have rightfully been ignored as thought marches onward and more and better evidence accumulates. Thus Aristotle's ""The Politics"" is of historical interest. It gives insight into what Greeks thought, and how their thought evolved into our modern theories of politics, but one will not find original insights into politics beyond the Greek isles around the 4th century BC. At its best, however, the book provides a sort of hidden genealogy of modern political thought. Aristotle spends much time dilating on the benefits of a ""mixed constitution"" of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy, but he leaned towards what he called a politeia (the same word as constitution), which constituted broad participation by a prosperous middle class. His belief that ""like should be treated alike,"" meant that he thought free men should all rule in turn, and should be chosen partially by vote and partially by lot, since even election would lend to the favoritism to a few. He wanted to both pay the poor to attend assemblies and also fine aristocrats for not attending them, to ensure the balance of interest in politics. You can see why James Madison liked him. At the end of Book IV Aristotle even divides government into a ""deliberative part,"" a""sovereign part,"" and a ""judicial part,"" a division that, although it does not quite map onto our modern one (especially because the deliberative element also appointed officials, while officials themselves had some authority to ""make laws"" and ""give orders"" and seemed almost sovereign in themselves), has obvious parallels. In Book III Chapter 11 Aristotle even makes a surprising argument for the wisdom of crowds by noting that ""each individual will indeed be a worse judge than the experts, but collectively they will be better,"" since they will all brings aspects of individual wisdom to bear. He mentions it as a defense of democracy.The book is also a helpful reminder that Greece was such a hothouse of ideas because it was a hothouse of different states and cities. Some cities elected by lot, some by family, some by vote, some by co-option, and many had combinations of all of these. Some gave citizenship to almost all, some to only soldiers, and many gave it to those with different property qualifications, with weights depending on how much people had. There were also an infinitude of ideal states, from Plato's the Republic, with its elite class of ""Guardians,"" and his The Laws, to Hippodamus's plan for a 10,000 person state with defenders sustained out of the public land. Luckily, Aristotle tends too much to the empirical and cataloguing sort of mind to go in much for ideals. He does discuss in the Book VII how age-groups should occupy different positions throughout their lives, how a powerful city should not be too large or too small, but should encompass access to the sea and trade, how only those with leisure (schule) should be free citizens, how inheritance laws should ensure broad and not concentrated ownership, how agricultural workers should be slaves, how Hippodamian regular streets should be combined with old-fashioned warrens to thwart invaders, and so forth. But on the whole he attacks, for instance, Plato and Phaleas for refusing to make amends for real-world issues, and for dreaming of only common property and common wives. Aristotle defends the value of diverse viewpoints and balanced constitutions. He is therefore the true founder of modern liberal theory. I just wish a modern editor had taken a hacking to most of the book.

11,Aaron Crofut,"A skim read; after sixteen years, it seemed worth the time to brush up on what the Philosopher had to say on politics, especially given how different politics in this nation have become since my sophomore year in college. Every young person catching the politics bug should take the time to read this book. The basics are all there. Other reviews will cover that for you. Again, this was a skim review for me; I wanted to remember some things lost and see what my mind would focus on different this time. What I came away with was this: * Man is a political animal. That's more than ""we take part in politics."" Much of who we become, our language, our culture, our ethics, our customs do not unfold from us sui generis. I was rather fortunate to be reading Dietrich von Hildebrand along with Aristotle. We need to evaluate our culture against an objective standard rather than taking that culture as the standard. At the same time, we cannot be hypercritical about these matters, either. Our polis needs to be maintained. Aristotle would appreciate the mean needed between blind acceptance and blind criticism of that which we inherit and should pass on to our offspring. * What is a city, a polis, a nation? The seem to be like rivers, the parts always changing and yet the whole always remaining. Yet if enough of the parts change, perhaps the whole ceases to be what it is. And the parts do change. The United States has changed considerably. It will continue to do so. But what are the essential elements that should not change, that if we changed them we would cease to be what we were? I think this is the big issue of our day. It's more than the libertarian social contract between people. * Friendship as a political value. This pops up a couple of times. I find it interesting that he specifically mention the threat of a small ruling class closing itself off to ""friendship"" with the lower classes, especially in marriage. The rulers are to rule with charity towards the ruled. That's unlikely to happen where the rulers see the ruled as foreigners. * The polis has a teleological end, something more than the social contract of Locke. Eudomnia, happiness, requires the city, and the city is aimed at that end. Passing on culture is an important aspect of that goal. * Causes of faction. I'm just going to refer the reader to Book V, Chapter 3. Some of those issues are at play today. * The three values a person needs to hold office: loyalty to constitution, capacity to do the job, and character (with an emphasis on justice). Does anyone running for President meet all three of those? * Perhaps the most important point of the work is in Book VII: politics is a means to an end, not an end in itself. * The point of education is not techne, but epistime. It is not just knowing how to do things, but in knowing itself.

12,David,"I began the book thinking Aristotle might have been progressive for his age. I now question that. He lived in a society which could be called progressive for its time - being a ""democracy"" for slaveholders. But Aristotle's reasoning strikes me as elitist justification for the status quo. At least in the translation I read, I found the text full of long, complex sentences with many clauses - perhaps like 19th century German scholars such as Max Weber's sentences.He argues that it is appropriate for people to be kept in a social class which is consistent with their abilities. Those whose capabilities are in physical strength are best suited to be slaves, and others are more suited to be slaveholders. But even if one accepts the general premises, a serious philosophical examination would raise questions about the real society he's defending. Aristotle doesn't criticize his society because it didn't test all children to determine each individual's abilities and then place them in the appropriate social class. Or, suppose a person's strengths and weaknesses best suited him for manual labor. Does it follow the same must be true of his children and grandchildren? A racist view might say yes, but did Aristotle's society occassionally say, ""This child of a slave is physically weak and has other characteristics more in common with another class, therefore he must be made free and given a fitting place in society? Was there never a child of a slaveholder who was strong, but not so smart?In Book I, Chapter IX:...for which reason it should seem that some boundary should be set to riches, though we see the contrary to this is what is practised; for all those who get riches add to their money without end; ... economy requires the possession of wealth, but not on its own account but with another view, to purchase things necessary therewith; but the other procures it merely to increase it: so that some persons are confirmed in their belief, that this is the proper object of economy, and think that for this purpose money should be saved and hoarded up without end; ... and if they cannot [endlessly increase wealth] merely by the art of dealing in money, they will endeavour to do it by other ways, and apply all their powers to a purpose they were not by nature intended for. Thus, for instance, courage was intended to inspire fortitude, not to get money by; neither is this the end of the soldier's or the physician's art, but victory and health. But such persons make everything subservient to money-getting, as if this was the only end; and to the end everything ought to refer.So, while Aristotle says wealth for wealth's sake is wrong, he seems to direct this more to people not of the slave-holding leisure class. In Politics, Aristotle expresses the idea that slaveholders have talents in managing slaves. I would think that doctors and trades people do more to earn their money, and (while I don't encourage mercenaries) one might think soldiers or others who risk their lives deserve more than those who give instructions to laborers.[Reading C. Wright Mills' The Power Elite, Mills tells how the ""old money"" elite look down upon the ""new money"" rich. It struck me: this sounds like Aristotle's attitude towards those who built their wealth on something other than slavery.](I don't actually know the answer, but I question whether the average slaveholder really knew more about the art of agriculture, in order to give superior instructions, than the average slave.)In Chapter XIII, he argues that slaves and women aren't devoid of virtues, but they are inherently of a different amount and type. For instance, it's inherent in the man to command and inherent in women to obey. (Did Aristotle know of Sappho who lived 200 years before him?) Aristotle writes, a slave should ""be trained to those virtues which are proper for his situation by his master.""I only read Book I and the beginning of Book II, but I think that was enough for my particualr purposes.

13,'Izzat Radzi,"I read this in concurrent with Cicero's De Republica, hence the time taken much longer and perhaps the frame of mind is different. In addition to that, as from the Preface, I read this starting from Book I-III, then VII-VIII and only then finished the remaining book.Maybe if I read it in a different way, or from a different publication (like the one recently published by Princeton) then my understanding of Aristotle's work is different. Truly enlightening read, since it deals with virtue and vice, the golden mean, the relativity of the best constitution in states and perhaps also the illustration of what a tyrant should do (in Book V) can be related to cheap-labor nowadays, where the higher echelons purposely kept the poor people poor to ensure they have to pay the most minimum. Of course, there're some critique on his views on slavery, woman position (and nature, for instance to suggest them to naturally ""always support"" tyrants amongst many others) and some other from Plato's, but I kept it later for further read of his work.Since we're talking about constitution too, it is also best to recollect yesterday UK supreme court (11 judges unanimous) decision of the UK parliament unlawful preroguing.

14,Ben,"One of the gifts I received for Christmas, which seems like such a long time ago now, was a £25 voucher to use on amazon. As soon as I saw the three-thousand digit code on the back of the card, I realised that there was only one thing I’d spend all that money on, books. That thought brought on a very rare occasion that I can’t take for granted: I made a rash decision and didn’t regret it. I bought The Collected Works of Plato, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, How to be both, Crime and Punishment, We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, I am Malala, and Aristotle’s Politics. I’ve only just finished reading Politics, and I supposed that there would be no better place to review and reflect on the book than on the blog that I’m using to talk about everything related to PPE.There were many interesting things about this book, both in its ideas and in its references to the ancient world. The most noteworthy point about this entire book though is that it’s clearly a criticism of everything that Plato had earlier written in his dialogues, and therefore Politics set off criticism that must have gone against the grain of popular opinion in the ancient world. To properly enjoy this book, I think it’s worth knowing a little about the history of Aristotle, and his role as a Philosopher. Aristotle was a genius that was heavily influenced by the ideas of Plato; so much so that he joined an institution called the Plato Academy. The Plato Academy was run by Plato himself, and filled with people who were inspired by the early analytical philosophy put forward by Plato, and who were entirely in his debt when it came to their studies. When Plato died and the Academy needed a new head – Aristotle was hopeful, but didn’t manage to get it. This is where I think Aristotle really began to turn away from following Plato, and became more creative and independent in his thought. Thus spoke Politics.If we take it for granted that The Republic was, in Ancient Greece, the most dominant and influential book on the proper order of a state, books I & II should have hit the reader with a sharp shock. In these two books, Aristotle is putting his ideas forward from a theoretical point of view, arguing the necessity of slaves, the position of commodities, children, and the fundamental forms of government. Aristotle agrees with Plato insofar as they are both able to identify Oligarchies, Democracies, Tyrannies, and Aristocracies as forms of government, but Aristotle also expands on this idea. Aristotle doesn’t include a Timocracy as a form of government as Plato did, as it has never truly materialised in any part of the world, but he does add Monarchies to the list, and improves on the definitions of the forms of government completely. The first two books are essentially the first harsh grip on the reader, arguing that there is wisdom in what Plato has taught us about the state, but that he sometimes oversteps his boundaries, and in doing so has ended up creating a state which is essentially against human nature. In the later books, Aristotle becomes more focused on reality; rather than using abstract thought and reasoning to bring the reader to his conclusions, he gives examples from history. When talking about how different states function, Aristotle doesn’t look at how they should function, but rather how they actually have. He references the Spartan state, the Celts, the Lacedemonias as evidence for his arguments, noting how they use their democratic, aristocratic or oligarchic forms on the populates that they raise, and in the final book (book VIII), the focus turns to the education of the youth, and focuses itself on the topics that students should learn in schools. In this manner, it can be argued that Aristotle was one of the first scientists, as he seemingly uses the history of states to provide evidence or disprove earlier hypotheses.I haven’t read any notes on this book, and haven’t had any guidance in my reading, so I may be missing out on some of the major points in thisAris quick overview, but that is how I would describe the contents of Politics to myself before having read this book, and what I’d say to myself as I write this blog post, just to refresh my mind. What is more important at this point is what I took away from the book, and whether I found it a worthwhile read, or whether I should have simply read some notes online and gotten a condensed version of his ideas.What’s really important to consider when reading classics on political science is how similar the ideas of the book are to the society you’re living in today, and from Aristotle’s description of a good and bad state, the function of magistrates and of the division between rich and poor, it’s clear that he has made a huge impact on the way that we view the function of a state from both the ruler’s point of view and from the subject’s point of view. One idea that caught my attention early on in the book was that there are many forms of the different states. A democracy, for example, will have similar features no matter where it is implemented, but won’t be the same from state to state. This is similar to Plato’s theory of forms, only more practical. There are definitions that make a democracy definably different from an oligarchy, but there is no way for a democracy to be implemented in the exact same way across the world, for there are many historical and cultural factors behind mask of these regimes. This may seem like an over exaggeration of common sense, but it was definitely an insight of genius for a high ranking philosopher of Ancient Greece to argue that he can’t explain every action that a state takes.Another surprising idea of Aristotle’s was that there are two extremes on a political spectrum, democracy and oligarchy, and that all other state systems fall somewhere in between these two. This is significant, as it may have been the foundation of what we now call the Right vs Left spectrum. Previously, in The Republic, it was argued that there were five forms of a state, and that countries would switch between them until they were satisfied, and then would switch again, based on the balance of justice. Aristotle added flux to this very static idea, arguing that there are two extremes, and that all civilisations fall somewhere between them: an idea that is still very, very modern.

15,Micah Jakubowicz,"4.5 stars. Some VERY important ideas in here. Unfortunately (not all Aristotle’s fault), there are a few extremely outdated ideas. But those only make up about 10% of this beautiful work. However, if you know anything about the history of political philosophy and the history of classical liberalism, (and you’ve never read this work before) you will be happily surprised to see most of the foundations in Aristotle’s Politics. This is the first major work that recognized that a society is ultimately built on individuals, not the collective like Plato thought. To build a reasonable and virtuous society, the individual has to work on themselves first, then the political landscape will eventually become virtuous, for lack of a better term. It is absolutely insane, misleading, and plain immoral to think that government should be the arbiters of truth and morality. Because ultimately, even the top government officials are just as human as we are, and are an equal citizen. Why then, should any government official, or governmental group, feel they have the right to dictate to ME what I should do, and how I should live my life? Enter the Enlightenment!! Enter Liberalism!!!Enter America!!Thank you Aristotle!!Of course I could go on and on about the importance and genius of Aristotle in this work, but suffice it to say, one of the greatest works of political philosophy ever.

16,Mr. Banks,"I’ll come up with a better set of takeaways later. Aristotle models the good from his set of ethic developed in the treatise of that name. His argument is that the state is constructed to enable the allow each citizen to pursue the good life. For if every citizen is good, then the state as a whole is good.What then follows is a set of prescriptions to create this good state. Aristotle, as a biologist, loves to characterize and classify, so we are treated to several chapters that define different form of states, their characteristics, and how they should function and survive.As for his proofs, a lot of it follows a consistent set of logic but the axioms, on which they are built, rests on the naturalistic argument and some hand-wavy notion of body and soul.Aristotle is also known as an “realist”, and it is this treatise that I finally have come to understand what is meant by that descriptor. Instead of focussing only on the theoretical arguments for a state, Aristotle provides a quell of practical ways on how to administer justice, construct the state, manage the youth and education, and even on what type of music its citizens should enjoy. Most of these applications follow social customs at the time, and appeal to authority from Homer’s poems and the ancient gods, so I didn’t find them convincing in the slightest.

17,Rowland Pasaribu,"In many ways, the Politics is a companion volume to the “Nicomachean Ethics”, in which Aristotle defines a life of good quality and sets about describing how it should be achieved. The Politics, to a large extent, is an effort to describe the kind of political association that would best facilitate the ends described in the Ethics.However, the Politics is not subservient to the Ethics. Aristotle's claim is not that cities must exist to serve the ends of individuals. Rather, he claims that individuals are to a large extent defined by the cities they live in and that man can be fully human (i.e. fully rational) only by participating in the city. The city is a complete whole and each individual is a mere part. The city is thus more important than the individual.The tension between practical and speculative reasoning is central to the Politics. Practical reasoning is necessary for political and social matters, while speculative reasoning is necessary for theoretical and philosophical problems. Ultimately, Aristotle concludes in both the Ethics and the Politics that speculative reasoning is superior, as it is through a proper exercise of this faculty that man achieves true happinessWhereas Aristotle views the exercise of speculative reasoning as and end in itself, he considers the exercise of practical reasoning an integral means to this end. Because an individual cannot learn to exercise his reason properly outside the confines of the city, and because the city is able to function only as a result of man's practical reasoning, practical reasoning is thus a prerequisite for the exercise of speculative reasoning.Interestingly, Aristotle never concerns himself with questions of how much authority the state should have over the individual. A central question of modern political philosophy is the extent to which the state should be able to impose itself on the freedom of the individual. This question would not have made sense to Aristotle because he saw the goal of the city and the goal of the individual as identical. While his assertion—that the individual is only a subservient part of the state—might seem mildly totalitarian, his view was that the individual could have no truly rational needs or interests outside the confines of the state. As a result, it would be absurd to desire any kind of individual freedom in opposition to the state.""Justice"" might seem an odd term for what is essentially the right to hold more distinguished public offices. It is important to remember, however, that in a Greek city-state, serving in public office was essential to citizenship and was a high distinction. Further, those who occupied places of high distinction were more likely to enjoy other benefits as well.Aristotle's method, here and elsewhere, is largely descriptive. He conducts extensive surveys of the different forms of government and theory and his own theory is less of a creative endeavor than Plato's in the “Republic”. Rather, it is a series of recommendations based on what he has observed. None of Aristotle's practical advice is particularly novel; his insights are more a synthesis of analyses by a man who has studied politics extensively.***Though the Politics ends quite abruptly with the discussion of some minor points of interest in regard to music, there is no reason to believe that some further section of the text has been lost. The Politics was compiled as lecture notes from the courses Aristotle taught at the Lyceum and was not intended for publication. The likely explanation for this ending, then, is that it marks the end of a specific lecture, though Aristotle perhaps taught further topics in political theory at another time.Aristotle's firm stance against any kind of skill or knowledge that comes to be utilized for someone else's sake epitomizes his means-end dichotomy. Practical reasoning serves the entire city, of which each individual is a part, and speculative reasoning serves one's own happiness; each type of reasoning has its end in the self. When an individual engages in an activity whose end is to please others, such as playing music, however, that individual becomes a means for others to achieve leisure, ceasing to be an end in himself.The aristocratic amateurism that Aristotle espouses evidences his elitist conception of class differences. Citizens should look down upon musicians and other such practitioners of arts because they practice their skill for the sake of others. Aristotle considers these practitioners simply a means for citizens to the end of leisure. As such, he inherently disparages the value of art for its own sake and the importance of art as self-expression—two notions integral to the modern conception of the self. Of course, ancient Greece was very different from the modern world. Citizens felt contempt for non-citizen manual laborers because their existence had worth only in the service of others. Their skills were not ends in themselves but rather means to others' ends.Aristotle's discussion of music is difficult to understand for a number of reasons. Foremost among these is that very little is known about what Greek music actually sounded like. Historians know what instruments the Greeks played and that they based their melodies on different modal arrangements, which they felt were expressive of different states of character or emotion. Historians also know that music was very important to the Greeks: they felt that certain harmonies were divine and that music could express character and moral virtues better than any other medium. Aristotle believes that music can serve moral purposes because it can, quite literally, ""represent"" states of character just as paintings can represent trees and houses. By representing a virtuous character, music can serve as a very powerful tool for moral instruction.

18,Denise,"There are most worthy scholars than me to comment on one of the major works of an astonishing mind. I give it however 4 stars because the translation is clumsy. It is difficult to stay true to the original text and render a smooth text that the reader today can appreciate. But it is possible! Further it was pure curiosity that led me to try reading Aristoteles‘ texts. His thinking influenced the ethical and political thinking of Europe for centuries. And this is enough reason for anyone today to go back to the roots! I cannot say that I grasp the whole spectrum of his ideas, but it is a beginning and I think it is necessary to try because he is part of our intellectual heritage and if we don’t know our past we cannot form the future!

If you are looking for foundational knowledge of politics, then this is definitely one to consider to get you started.The book explains different regimes such as democracies, oligarchies, aristocracies as well as tyrannies and mixes between them all. As well as this, there are sections on what a good citizen is, the best way for regimes to govern along with generalship/war, revolutions and familial relationships.I found this to be a very stimulating read, and throughout the book it had me thinking about life in ways I hadn't done before, both my personal life to date and also the world we live in today.

20,Phil Filippak,"Built on the premise that the state is more important than any singular person, this book demonstrates a good enough reasoning on how to legislate in the state, build its economy, and avoid people's discontent. I believe the approach described is just one of many possible approaches to those matters. Maybe it is even among optimal ones. But. That is only on the premise that the state is more important than a person. And how that should be true, I don't know.

Both sexist, justifying slavery, and easily criticizable considering modern developments, Aristotle makes broad assumptions based on his time that he applies universally. Very interesting to see the close correspondence of the form of government he advocates (moderate between aristocracy/polity) with the form of government that is common in Western society nowadays.",it was ok
22,Anmol,"Reading his Ethics before this is a must. They overlap a bit, and work off one another (he probably gave these lectures around the same period). I like the discussion on music and exercise, building on the same interesting Greek tradition from Plato. It's a difficult read, not because of content but because the writing style is just disastrous.

29,Doug,"This was more interesting than I thought it would be. Throughout Ancient Greece in the days prior to Aristotle, there were numerous city states, many of which were frequently being overthrown either with revolution or war (see the History of the Peloponnesian War or Histories). Many of these city states experimented with a wide range different types of government. In Aristotle’s politics, he analyzes them in an inquiry to find the problems that different factors beget, the chief end of government, and attempts to articulate elements of the ideal government or constitution.The work is surprisingly relevant to the on-going discussions in society today. The issue of income inequality is raised and analyzed, discussion how property should be distributed among populations. Various competing senses of justice are discussed. The nature of equality and inequality are considered, along with whether different positions on can be reconciled. He discusses the role of the middle class in a stable society (I never knew the concept of “middle class” to be this ancient). If we really want to avoid creating undue misery for people, we would do well to be familiar with Aristotle’s analysis and arguments.In the process of his analysis, Aristotle makes a wide range of references to other works, people, and events. In book 2, he has an extended critique of Socrates’ Republic.Here are a number of things that particularly struck me (references: 1/2 means book 1, chapter 2):* (1/2) “For man, when perfected, is the best of animals, but, when separated from law and justice, he is the worst of all; since armed injustice is the more dangerous, and he is equipped at birth with arms, meant to e used by intelligence and virtue, which he may use for the worst ends. Wherefore, if he have not virtue, he is the most unholy and the most savage of animals, and the most full of lust and gluttony.”* (1/2) “Justice is the bond of men in states, for the administration of justice, which is the determination of what is just, is the principle of order in political society.” (I think von Mises would disagree with this statement.)* (1/3) “Others affirm that the rule of a master over slaves is contrary to nature, and that the distinction between slave and freeman exists by law only, and not by nature; and being an interference with nature is therefore unjust.”* (2/3) “For that which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it. … everybody is more inclined to neglect the duty which he expects another to fulfill.” (This is why big cities strangle a sense of personal responsibility in the populace toward elements in the city.)* (2/5) “No one, when men have all things in common, will any longer set an example of liberality or do any liberal action; for liberality consists in the use which is made of property. Such legislation may have a specious appearance of benevolence; men readily listen to it, and are easily induced to believe that in some wonderful manner everybody will become everybody’s friend, especially when some one is heard denouncing the evils now existing in states, suits about contracts, convictions of perjury, flatteries of rich men and the like, which are said to arise out of the possession of private property. These evils, however, are due to a very different cause—the wickedness of human nature.”* (2/6) “Some, indeed, say that the best constitution is a combination of all existing forms, and they praise the Lacedaemonian because it is made up of oligarchy, monarchy, and democracy.” (Sounds reminiscent of the US Constitution and its three branches of government.)* (2/7) “…it is not the possessions but the desires of mankind which require to be equalized, and this is impossible, unless a sufficient education is provided by the laws.”* (2/7) “The fact is that the greatest crimes are caused by excess and not by necessity. Men do not become tyrants in order that they may not suffer cold;”* (2/7) “…for it is the nature of desire not to be satisfied, and most men live only for the gratification of it. The beginning of reform is not so much to equalize property as to train the noble sort of natures not to desire more, and to prevent the lower from getting more; that is to say, they must be kept down, but not ill-treated.”* (3/9) “For the one party, if they are unequal in one respect, for example wealth, consider themselves to be unequal in all; and the other party, if they are equal in one respect, for example free birth, consider themselves to be equal in all.”* (3/9) “…a state exists for the sake of a good life, and not for the sake of life only.”* (3/10) “There is also a doubt as to what is to be the supreme power in the state: Is it the multitude? Or the wealthy? Or the good? Or the one best man? Or a tyrant? Any of these alternatives seems to involve disagreeable consequences. If the poor, for example, because they are more in number, divide among themselves the property of the rick — is not this unjust? No, by heaven (will be the reply), for the supreme authority justly willed it. But if this is not injustice, pray what is? Again, when in the first division, all has been taken, and the majority divide anew the property of the minority, is it not evident, if this goes on, that they will ruin the state?”* (3/15) “We will being by inquiring whether it is more advantageous to be ruled by the best man or by the best laws. The advocates of royalty maintain that the laws speak only in general terms, and cannot provide for circumstances; and that for any science to abide by written rules is absurd. … Hence it is clear that a government acting according to written laws is plainly not the best. Yet surely the ruler cannot dispense with the general principle which exists in law… The best man, then, must legislate, and laws must be passed, but these laws will have no authority when they miss the mark, though in all other cases retaining their authority.”* (3/15) “…the many are more incorruptible than the few.” (Interesting statement that pre-dates mass media. I think that the many are putty in the hands of the few, so this principle is less true than once it was.)* (4/11) “…the poor and the rich quarrel with one another, and whichever side gets the better, instead of establishing a just or popular government, regards political supremacy as the prize of victory, and the one party sets up a democracy and the other an oligarchy.” * (5/1) “Those who excel in virtue have the best right of all to rebel … but then they are of all men the least inclined to do so.”* (5/4) “Well begun is half done.” (In my translation, he’s quoting this statement, not coining it.)* (5/8) “No ordinary man can discern the beginning of evil, but only the true statesman.”* (5/9) “If equality of property is introduced, the state must of necessity take another form; for when by laws carried to excess one or other element in the state is ruined, the constitution is ruined.”* (5/9) “But of all the things I have mentioned that which most contributes to the permanence of constitutions is the adaptation of education to the form of government, and yet in our own day this principle is universally neglected. The best laws, though sanctioned by every citizen of the sate, will be of no avail unless the young are trained by habit and education in the spirit of the constitution, if the laws are democratically, democratically, or oligarchically, if the laws are oligarchical. For there may be a want of self-discipline in states as well as individuals.”* (5/9) “Now, to have been educated in the spirit of the constitution is not to perform the actions in which oligarchs or democrats delight, but those by which the existence of an oligarchy or of a democracy is made possible. Whereas among ourselves the sons of the ruling class in an oligarchy live in luxury, but the sons of the poor are hardened by exercise and toil, and hence they are both more inclined and better able to make a revolution. And in democracies of the more extreme type there has arisen a false idea of freedom which is contradictory to the true interests of the state. For two principles are characteristic of democracy, the government of the majority and freedom. Men think that what is just is equal; and that equality is the supremacy of the popular will; and that freedom means the doing what a man likes. In such democracies every one lives as he pleases, or in the words of Euripides, ‘according to his fancy.’ But this is all wrong; men should not think it slavery to live according to the rule of the constitution; for it is their salvation.”* (5/10) “History shows that almost all tyrants have been demagogues who gained the favor of the people by their accusation of the notables.”* (6/4) “Every man should be responsible to others, nor should any one be allowed to do just as he pleases; for where absolute freedom is allowed there is nothing to restrain the evil which is inherent in every man.” (A strong argument against von Mises position in Liberalism)* (7/7) “But the Hellenic race … if it could be formed into one state, would be able to rule the world.” (Fascinating statement made by the tutor of Alexander the Great, who tried to do just this.)* (7/8) “a state is not a community of living beings only, but a community of equals, aiming at the best life possible. Now, whereas happiness is the highest good, being a realization and perfect practice of virtue, which some can attain, while others have little or none of it.”* (7/13) “This makes men fancy that external goods are the cause of happiness, yet we might as well say that a brilliant performance on the lyre was to be attributed to the instrument and not to the skill of the performer.”* (7/14) “…he who would learn to command well must, as men say, first of all learn to obey.”* (8/3) “To be always seeking after the useful does not become free and exalted souls.”
