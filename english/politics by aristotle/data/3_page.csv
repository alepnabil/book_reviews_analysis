0,Domhnall,"In about 350 BC Europe was about to embark on an era of civilisation for which Aristotle wrote the users manual. When his student, Alexander the Great, conquered a huge territory from Turkey to Afghanistan, Hellenic philosophy sparked changes including the transformation of Judaism from a primitive to a more sophisticated type of religion. It is not surprising to find similarities there and in the writings of St Paul to the views first articulated by Aristotle nor – in a pleasing symmetry - that medieval popes thought Aristotle must have been divinely inspired to anticipate so much of their own beliefs. Renaissance and early modern political theory owed everything to the rediscovery of the Greeks and not least Aristotle, and it is not hard to recognise his Politics recycled through Locke’s Treatises on Government or the constitution of the United States. In debates with modern Americans, the habitual insistence on appealing to first principles and to Natural Law, subordinating many human rights to property rights, and women to men, are all familiar territory to readers of Aristotle. I suspect there are many different and valid ways to read Aristotle’s Politics but to understand European political history it is absolutely essential to be aware of it. Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics concludes in the view that a life of virtue requires “right laws” and hence we need to examine how such legislation can be accomplished. “But it is difficult to get from youth up a right training for virtue if one has not been brought up under right laws; for to live temperately and hardily is not pleasant to most people, especially when they are young. … This is why some think that legislators ought to stimulate men to virtue and urge them forward by the motive of the noble, on the assumption that those who have been well advanced by the formation of habits will attend to such influences; and that punishments and penalties should be imposed on those who disobey and are of inferior nature, while the incurably bad should be completely banished. … the man who is good must be well trained and habituated, and go on to spend his time in worthy occupations and neither willingly nor unwillingly do bad actions, and this can be brought about if men live in accordance with a sort of reason, and right order, provided this has force… It would seem from what has been said that he can do this better if he makes himself capable of legislating. For public control is plainly effected by laws, and good control by good laws…”  [N Ethics Book X Ch 9] The Politics itself opens with a firm assertion of the centrality of politics: “Every state is a community of some kind and every community is established with a view to some good; for mankind always act in order to obtain that which they think good. But, if all communities aim at some good, the state or political community, which is the highest of all, and which embraces all the rest, aims at good in a greater degree than any other, and at the highest good.” [Bk 1, Ch 1] In Book 1, Aristotle constructs his vision of the political community from simple elements which, to his mind, are a necessary state of affairs. “In the first place there must be a union of those who cannot exist without each other; namely, of male and female, that the race may continue (…because, in common with other animals and with plants, mankind have a natural desire to leave behind them an image of themselves), and of natural ruler and subject, that both may be preserved… Out of these two relationships between man and woman, master and slave, the first thing to arise is the family. The family is the association established by nature for the supply of men’s everyday wants, … But when several families are united, and the association aims at something more than the supply of daily needs, the first society to be formed is the village… When several villages are united in a single complete community, large enough to be nearly of quite self-sufficing, the state comes into existence, originating in the bare needs of life and continuing in existence for the sake of the good life. “Hence it is evidence that the state is a creation of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal. And he who by nature and not by mere accident is without a state is either a bad man or above humanity; he is like the < tribeless, lawless, hearthless one> whom Homer denounces – the natural outcast is fortwith a lover of war… Now that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other gregarious animal is evident. Nature as we often say, makes nothing in vain, and man is the only animal whom she has endowed with the gift of speech. And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure of pain, and is therefore found in other animals… the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and the inexpedient, and likewise the just and the unjust. And it is a characteristic of man that he alone has any sense of good and evil, of just and unjust and the like, and the association of living beings who have this sense makes a family and a state.” [Bk 1 Ch 2]. “…the first and fewest possible parts of a family are master and slave, husband and wife, father and children.” [Bk 1 Ch 3] “…Property is a part of the household and the art of acquiring property is part of the art of managing the household; for no man can live well, or indeed live at all, unless he be provided with the necessaries… a possession is an instrument for maintaining life. And so, in the arrangement of the family, a slave is a living possession, and property a number of such instruments. … he who is by nature not his own but another’s man, is by nature a slave, and he may be said to be another’s man who, being a human being, is also a possession.” [Bk1 Ch 4]“For that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.” [Bk 1 Ch 5]""It is clear that the rule of the soul over the body and of the mind and the rational element over the passionate, is natural and expedient, whereas the equality of the two or the rule of the inferior is always hurtful. The same holds good of animals in relation to men; for tame animals have a better nature than wild, and all tame animals are better off when they are ruled by man, for then they are preserved. Again, the male is by nature superior, and the female inferior; and the one rules, the other is ruled; this principle, of necessity, extends to all mankind…” [Bk1 ch 5]Book II sets out to consider the broad principles of the distribution of political power and material wealth. After criticising Plato’s two ideal states, The Republic and The Laws, and then the theories of Hippodamus, it discusses the constitutions of a range of states – Lacedaemonian (Sparta), Cretan, Carthaginian – and identifies their limitations. Book III asks “who is the citizen and what is the meaning of the term.” He suggests “He who has the power to take part in the deliberative or judicial administration of any state is said to be a citizen of that state and, speaking generally, a state is a body of citizens sufficient for the purposes of life.” [Bk III Ch 1]. Aristotle acknowledges diverse constitutional arrangements are possible, and suggests that there are true forms and perversions: “The words constitution and government have the same meaning and the government, which is the supreme authority in states, must be in the hands of one, or of a few, or of the many. The true forms of government, therefore, are those in which the one, the few or the many govern with a view to the common interest; the governments which rule with a view to the private interest, whether of the one, or of the few, or of the many, are perversions.” [Bk III Ch 7]. There follows an elaborate discussion of the claims made for different forms of rule. Book IV questions what kind of government is best adapted to a particular state, with a warning that “political writers, although they have excellent ideas, are often impractical…. Any change of government which has to be introduced should be one which men, starting from their existing constitutions, will be both willing and able to adopt, since there is quite as much trouble in the reformation of an old constitution as in the establishment of a new one, just as to unlearn is has hard as to learn. … We must know the varieties and the number of varieties of each form of government, if only with a view to making laws. For the same laws cannot be equally suited to all oligarchies or to all democracies, since there is certainly more than one form both of democracy and of oligarchy.” [Bk IV Ch 1] He warns, too, of the risks in any form of government. E.g. “For in democracies that are subject to the law, the best citizens hold the first place, and there are no demagogues; but where the laws are not supreme, there demagogues spring up… At any event, this sort of democracy, which is now a monarch, and no longer under the control of law, seeks to exercise monarchical sway, and grows into a despot; the flatterer is held in honour, this sort of democracy being relative to other democracies what tyranny is to other forms of monarchy.” [Bk IV Ch 4]. He later advocates “Thus it is manifest that the best political community is formed by citizens of the middle-class, and that those states are likely to be well administered, and stronger if possible than both the other classes, or at any rate then either singly; for the addition of the middle class turns the scale, and prevents either of the extremes from being dominant…” [Bk IV Ch 11] and in chapter 12 he describes techniques by which both oligarchies and democracies set out to deceive the people. Book V looks into circumstances leading to revolution against the government of a state. He suggests that “Revolutions in democracies are generally caused by the intemperance of the magistrates.” They arise in oligarchies when the people are oppressed or when there is a quarrel among the oligarchs. They arise in aristocracies “when the mass of the people are of the high spirited kind and have a notion they are as good as their rulers.” He later considers the same for monarchy and tyranny. Useful cautions are these: “Again, the revolution may be accomplished by small degrees; I mean that a great change may sometimes slip into the constitution through neglect of a small matter...” “The citizens begin by giving up some part of the constitution, and so with greater ease the government change something else which is a little more important, until they have undermined the whole fabric of the state.”Book VI looks into various forms of government. He suggests that “democracy and demos in their truest forms are based upon recognized principles of democratic justice, that all should count equally.”  [Bk VI Ch 2]. “The first and best attempered of oligarchies is akin to a constitutional government.” [Ch 5]. Book VII argues that “the form of government is best in which every man, whoever he is, can act best and live happily.""  The choices discussed – such as the ideal population size – suggest the this is largely relevant to the ancient world in which the Greeks established new colonies all around the Mediterranean. Book VIII examines the education of citizens. “Since the whole city has one end, it is manifest that education should be one and the same for all, and that it should be public and not private - … Neither must we suppose that any one of the citizens belongs to himself; for they all belong to the state and are each of them a part of the state and the care of each part is inseparable from the care of the whole. … That education should be regulated by law and should be an affair of the state is not to be denied… [but] mankind are by no means agreed about the things to be taught….” [Book VIII Ch 1,2]

2,Borum,"This is my first time at reading Aristotle, and I thought I was ready after being trained by Plato's dialogues. Boy was I mistaken. I also made the error of not reading the Nichomachean Ethics before reading the Politics. It might not have mattered, but I'm considering reading the Politics again after I read the Ethics to get a better grasp at Aristotle's idea of political virtue and the difference between the virtue of man and the virtue of a citizen.Aristotle and Plato is like the two sides of a coin, and I'm planning on reading a book called The Cave and the Light: Plato Versus Aristotle, and the Struggle for the Soul of Western Civilization after reading their works. It's fascinating how the teacher and the student can differ so much on basically the same issue. They are both preoccupied with how we can make men happier and thus are always questioning the main way for man to become happy, i.e. the virtue of man and man's society. I'm glad I read this after reading Plato's Republic, as I had some questions and objections regarding Plato's idealized and probably improbable republic with a tinge of totalitarianism. Aristotle criticizes Plato's Republic and some of his other works and even goes on to point out the faults of the other actual regimes in the vicinity. However, I'm still left with the question: so, what's the alternative, then?This is an important question, because unlike Plato, Aristotle doesn't linger on the discussion of 'what' virtue is, but moves on the main question of 'how' to attain that virtue and whether the ideal virtue is actually attainable or feasible in the given circumstances. This is reflected in his classification of the different sort of economic and educational activities and his search for the not only the 'best' regime and legislation in the unqualified sense, but also the 'best' regime and legislation according to the different cities. However, he keeps reminding us that all these economic, educational and administrative and adjudicative activities and systems are just the 'means' to achieve the real 'end (telos)' Man is a political animal that intentionally establish political communities not just for self-sustenance but also for the pleasure of living together and the virtue of a noble life. Insomuch as money is just the means and currency used in economic activities and should not become its aim, all the regime and legislation and the components and systems of a city are the means to achieve that political virtue. Even the people should not forget that their wealth, birth or number are just circumstantial merits in becoming full citizens and remain the mere tools of political power play and actively participate in order to achieve their true common goal. The first reading left me feeling a little alienated (disgusted, to be honest) by Aristotle's blatant stance to denigrate anyone who is not a citizen of Athens (including women, slaves and foreigners) but I tried to get over that by reminding myself not to judge him on my own anachronistic point of view. Then I got put off by his opposition to democracy but I later learned his distinction between democracy and polity and also learned of the demagoguery in the years during and after the Peloponnesian War. I'm still a little disappointed in his conservative tendency to stick to the status quo, but after having got over with it, I'm finding interesting and even quite astute points being made throughout the book. I'm only sorry that the book is not fully restored. Books 6 and 8 are inconclusive and some pages seemed to have become either physically lost in antiquity or lost in translation. I'm hoping that reading other works by Aristotle (Nichomachean Ethics, Metaphysics) will give me a more complete picture.

3,Thomas Hammer,"Aristotle is alright, but he is so... earthbound, like he didn't join the other Chads to uncover the eleusinian mysteries. Politics doesn't really present a coherent argument nor an outline of his idea of an ideal political structure. Rather it talks about various systems in abstract and in concrete, their characteristics, benefits, pitfalls, and how this has manifested historically. Boring, without poetical nor metaphorical beauty, doesn't soar to the heights, stays within the four walls of common sense.Plato > Aristotle

4,Alan Johnson,"(Note: The Goodreads description of this second edition of the Carnes Lord translation is in a language other than English. However, the ASIN [Kindle] and ISBN [paperback] numbers refer to Carnes Lord's English translation, which is the subject of the following review.)I initially read Sir Ernest Barker's translation of Aristotle's Politics in 1965. The present edition by Carnes Lord includes an excellent translation and introduction with helpful endnotes regarding the meaning of important Greek terms, relevant ancient history, alternative translations, and variations in the manuscript sources. As for Aristotle's work itself, one finds many objectionable things (slavery, the inferior role of women typical of ancient Athenian society, the also typical incorporation of the religious priesthood into the government of the polis, the limitations of citizenship, and so forth) as well as some important insights. Ever the empiricist, Aristotle discusses at great length the many varieties of government that the Greeks and others had created during and before his era. All in all, it is quite a puzzling picture for us denizens of the twenty-first century. At some point, I may do a more exhaustive critique of the Politics, but other scholarly projects preoccupy me at the moment. The five-star rating is for the editorial and translation work of the subject edition. It is impossible to rate Aristotle himself, but the fact that his work has survived for more than two millennia is itself an indication that we can still learn from him, even while disagreeing with some of his apparent teachings. In this connection, no less a democrat than Thomas Jefferson wrote, with regard to the Declaration of Independence (which he substantially authored), that ""[a]ll its authority rests then on the harmonizing sentiments of the day, whether expressed in conversation, in letters, printed essays, or in the elementary books of public right, as Aristotle, Cicero, Locke, Sidney, &c."" Thomas Jefferson to Henry Lee, May 8, 1825, in Thomas Jefferson: Writings, ed. Merrill D. Peterson (New York: Library of America, 1984), 1501. Many historians and political scientists also attribute certain aspects of the U.S. Constitution (especially the mixed nature of the republican framework) to Aristotle's Politics. Aristotle is not the last word, but his contribution to political philosophy should not be ignored.

5,C.P.,"What is remarkable is how little has changed in the conservative and liberal positions since Aristotle. Some of it reads like it came from a recent blog.My interest in finishing reading this classic is to provide some context for my discussion of the polis and the oikos in the second and, hopefully soon, first published edition of my book ""Popular Capitalism"". The treatment of the oikos was superficial and none of analysis applied to the polis was used in a deeper analysis of the oikos. Federation and empire were also treated superficially as the polis writ large. The political analysis, or what passes for it today, of the liberal and conservative adopt the same superficiality resulting in their error of making no distinctions between the levels of government, nor between individuals, families, households and corporations as ""private"" entities.On the other hand, Aristotle's analysis of education as a preparation for one's role in the polis is accurate and, though limited to the single role of citizenship and omitting the crucial mechanism of the examination, is an excellent basis for an analysis encompassing the merit examinations for civil service advocated by Carl Schurz, academia and vocational training.Most of the book is devoted to the study of constitutions and directed toward goals from his book on Ethics with the emphasis of the Socratic school on seeking the morally ""good"" or ""best"" of everything. Though I find no merit in morality, I can see where this study could afford an excellent introduction to comparative political science, including the effect of philosophical bias on those studies.

6,E.H. Nolan,"First, read Plato’s Republic. Then you can read Aristotle. It’s only fair, since he was Plato’s student and protégé. If you’re not used to political writings, especially ancient ones, this might seem a little daunting, but trust me, you’ll get through it. You can look at it with irony, sadness, or happiness at human relativity, but the truth is politics hasn’t changed that much through the centuries. Entire college courses have been devoted to studying Aristotle’s philosophies, and we’re still not any closer to finding the meaning of life than he was!In Politics, Aristotle asks questions about the individual’s role in society. How should one conduct himself in order to be useful to the state and to his fellow citizens? He delves into the nature of an ideal society, much like his teacher Plato did in The Republic.  Those who have already studied Plato will see the student, clearly admiring his mentor but wanting to contribute his own theories to the same questions, and that in itself makes it a fascinating read.If you’re interested in studied the Founding Fathers of philosophy and “the ideal society”, Plato and Aristotle are must-reads. Just take it slow and don’t get overwhelmed by the structure. (But don’t worry if you get overwhelmed and take a long time to get through it. I was a political science student and got overwhelmed myself!) Just remember that he’s just like you: wondering, unsure, and hopeful.http://hottoastyrag.weebly.com/politi...

7,Browne,"My initial review for this was getting to around 2000 words which is the longest continuous piece of writing I've done since uni (life has been very undemanding since then) so clearly this book fulfils the criteria of being thought provoking. I'll dump that vomit in an anonymous blog or something.Aristotle is alien to the modern Western spirit of politics. His ideal state features slaves, extremely limited if not absent democracy, a rejection of the idea of 'the dignity of labour' especially for the ruling classes (see this excellent essay on the matter by Nietzsche: ""The Greek State"" http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche...), a disdain for money and international trade (""[states] should not become marketplaces for the world"" how anathema is this to the values which politicians and entrepreneurs now espouse?), and a strict hierarchy, amongst other things.These ideas ought to be dealt with seriously and not merely cast off because they bump up against the moral truisms of our age, maybe you find yourself agreeing with Aristotle on these points? He certainly argues logically, as you would expect, equally there are good arguments you could raise against him.Besides all this, the book serves as a cool glance at the various constitutions of the Ancient Greek world.

8,Bryan,"The irony of me calling Aristotle's work average is not lost on me.: Yep, I feel way over my head giving Aristotle three stars, but I'm throwing in my two cents anyhow.  This book is an incredible window into another time. Aristotle's views on a number of topics (women and slavery come quickly to mind) stand out so opposed to our beliefs today that it's almost worth reading this book just to get some perspective on how new some of the social ideas we take for granted really are. Getting that sense of perspective is truly the best part of this book.  That said, there is little here beyond that for anyone but a student of philosophy or someone engaging in a very serious study of the history of government. Very little of what Aristotle says rings true today and at times it's as if he went to the future and decided to predict the exact opposite of what's come to pass.  If you are a layperson looking for a classic on government, I recommend Plato's Republic. While it is even older than Aristotle's work, it is filled with insights that feel as if they must have been written in modern times. That is a truly inspiring feat of thought and foresight.

9,Michael Koby,"Before reading this I read Plato's ""The Republic"" which is spent defining justice. This book deals more in the politics of the city. Who are it's citizens, who are not citizens, what kinds of governments are there, why some should be considered better than others, and how the people are raised, educated, and participate in their government.I liked this better than I liked ""The Republic"", maybe because this deals more with solid principles where ""The Republic"" was looking to define a more abstract principle. However, I fell both books are extremely relevant today, maybe ""Politics"" more so given it's subject matter.I do feel I need to read ""Nicomachean Ethics"" as it's the other side of the coin to ""Politics"" and maybe it'll give a better look at Aristotle's bigger picture.

11,Joe Basile,"Any serious student of ancient philosophy will advise that in order to fully understand Aristotle's Politics, it is essential to first read his Nicomachean Ethics. Why? Because Aristotle firmly believed that ethics and politics are closely linked.

25,GUILLAUME ATTIA,"That ‘Man is a political animal’ is unquestionably Aristotle’s most popular saying. It is generally taken to mean that what makes us human, or at least separates us from animals, is the observable fact that we engage in political activity. This unique human trait is of course an entailment of our rationality. So understood, Aristotle’s celebrated words may seem unimaginative. It does not appear in hindsight that one needs the brainpower of a genius to appreciate the resonance of this simple observation. However, when one places those famous words in their proper context, as part of Aristotle’s inquiry into the role of community in human life, one soon recognizes not only the profundity of so simple an observation but also the sophisticated intellect needed to make it. Aristotle was indeed a profound thinker and the Politics is a reflection of that. Hence when Aristotle says that “man is a political animal” (p.10), for example, he is not simply stating the obvious fact that human beings engage in politics. His deeper, and more radical, point is that it is only in the polis or city that human beings can truly prosper and flourish. It is in the city that human beings fulfill the potentialities of their nature. How does the city enable humans to achieve their full potential? The community provides the structure through which humans are able to use their God-given reason and language to philosophize with other human beings in order to partner in the creation of a just community. As he explains it, “language serves to declare what is advantageous and what is reverse” (p.11) but also to deliberate about good and evil, justice and injustice, and many other concepts that need to be understood and agreed upon by members of a community in order to establish a good society. The importance of language for political organization, particularly the establishment of a sound constitution, was not taken for granted by the social contract theorists of the 17th century and beyond. The great John Rawls (1921 – 2002), for example, saw it as a foundational precondition of good governance that citizens have a serious discussion among themselves about which theory of justice should permeate their political decisions. Such compacts would not be possible without the capacity for reasoned discourse. Aristotle argues that it is this capacity for rational discussion, and no other, which “is the peculiarity of man, in comparison with other animals” (p.11). It is language therefore, or more precisely rationality, rather than a capacity to be political, that is the distinguishing feature of humanity. Thus contrary to popular belief, Aristotle did not in fact believe that humans were the only political animals. This can plainly be seen in the text when he specifies a few lines after declaring that ‘man is a political animal’ that he is so “in a higher degree than bees or other gregarious animals” (p.10). In his History of Animals, Aristotle observes that ants and bees are ‘political’ in the sense that they work together for a common goal or purpose (487b33 – 488a12). While humans do the same, “man alone of the animals is furnished with the faculty of language” (p.11). That is what makes him unique. That being said, humanity’s rational capacity is not accidental. “Nature”, Aristotle explains, “makes nothing in vain” (p.10): nature, or nature’s god, intended for language to be a gateway for communal living. The city therefore is a natural institution. The city not only exists by nature but is “prior in the order of nature to the family and the individual” (p.11). Not only is the city a natural institution but also by extension, city living itself is a natural state of being for human beings. It thus follows that it is simply unnatural for man, on Aristotle’s view, to live a life outside of the polis. Such a man, “the man who is isolated, who is unable to share in the benefits of political association, or has no need to share because he is already self-sufficient, is no part of the city, and must therefore be either a beast or a god” (p.11). This view of civilized existence as being inextricably bound to the communal life of the city was deeply influential in shaping Western perceptions of certain nomadic native Indian tribes. As Anthony Pagden relates in ""The Fall of Man"" (1982), for Spanish Conquistadors and British colonists of the Americas migratory groups could not ""create cities nor any form of civil association for the simple reason that civil association depends upon temporal continuity, upon the creation of a social space with its appropriate social and religious institutions and the cultural forms which accompany them. If, indeed, the civil life is to be largely defined as a life lived in cities, then it is obvious that people who live in tents, who are pastoralists or even hunter-gatherers rather than agriculturists, will be unable to develop a true community. Nomadism was consequently held to be inimical to every aspect of civilised life” (Pagden, 1982: 195).

26,Jacob Aitken,"I'll put my cards on the table.  I actively dislike Greek philosophy.  I will be fair and admit that Aristotle is a fairly good communicator, and despite his worldview, he stumbles across the truth every now and then.  And while he never really gets to a coherent statement on justice, he's important to read on that point.  Given that many ""woke"" evangelicals are talking about social justice (but never defining it), Aristotle is at least a starting point.(1) Every community is established with an aim to some good.Aristotle begins with the most basic social unit and moves outward (family, village, city).1.1 If the family is natural, and the movements outward are natural, then the state is a natural unity.The Art of Getting WealthLegitimate economics: managing a household“Retail trade is not a natural part of the art of getting wealth” (1.9.17).  This is important and will doom his entire project.Usury: makes a gain out of money itself.  The proper use of money is exchange, not to grow money from money.I used to hold to that argument. I'm not so sure anymore. It only works if we view value as something objective.  But value is anything but objective.  The whole point of an exchange is that we don't place equal value on the object.What is a state? Who is the citizen?  He notes that a citizen under one government might not be one under another. For the sake of argument he will assume democracy.  A citizen is the holder of a definite office, who legislates and judges, etc. (Book 3 ch. 1). A citizen shares in rulership. This is actually a pretty good definition, though it works better on smaller levels.The chief end of a state is the well-being of the citizensJustice: implies a relation to persons as well as things; a just distribution (Book 3; chapter 9).  He realizes this discussion is inadequate 9 pages later: “equality or inequality of what?” He hints that what is “just” or equal will be to the advantage of the common good.Book 4His famous discussion of monarchy, oligarchy, and democracy.  And their perversions. He defines democracy as the form of govt where the free are rulers (IV.4).  He comes to a surprising and welcome conclusion: the best society is the one with a large middle class.  This comes very close to a biblical worldview. It is not a biblical worldview, however, for Aristotle despises things like retail trade.  But a society with a large middle class is one that understands the value of time, risk, and planning. In other words, it presupposes the doctrine of providence.  Aristotle, however, doesn’t really get this, nor could he.This is why we should not go to Aristotle for economic wisdom.  For the godly man, time is not evil.  It is limited and under the curse, but it also provides the conditions for planning for the future and building wealth.Book VIIThis book begins on a chilling note: what are the most eligible forms of life?  This sounds a lot like the death camps we would have seen under the worst acts of the Affordable Care Act.  This is also good Greek philosophy.Before we examine why Aristotle thought it was good to kill some of the babies, we need to see why he said it.  He didn’t believe an overly-populated city was a good thing. That’s a half-truth. Many large cities today aren’t very nice places.  He probably couldn’t see past the city-state idea. You can have many people in a country if you have lots of smaller cities. That’s one example.With this background, his following comments, while evil, cohere with his system.  This is his argument:(1) To the size of states there is a limit (1326a 35).(2) The legislator must mold to his will the frames of newly-born children (1335a 5)(3) As to the exposure and rearing of children, let there be a law that no deformed child shall live, but that on the ground of an excess in the number of children, if the established customs of this state forbid this (for in our state population has a limit), no child is to be exposed, but when couples have children in excess, let abortion be procured before sense and life have begun (1335b 20-25).Is it really necessary to refute this?  Where to start? I’ll leave with an observation: given Aristotle’s anti-market views, his state population would always be extremely limited. That made abortion a pressing reality.  Therefore, his bad economics upheld his pro-choice mentality.

27,Fraser Kinnear,"Two pages into this book, Aristotle drops this turd:But is there any one thus intended by nature to be a slave, and for whom such a condition is expedient and right, or rather is not all slavery a violation of nature? There is no difficulty in answering this question, on grounds both of reason and of fact. For that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for ruleYikes. I remember MacIntyre grimacing over Aristotle’s position on slavery in his book “After Virtue”, which is trying to take the best of Aristotle’s ethical philosophy (orient your morals around the teleology of the subject) while brushing aside some of Aristotle’s worst conclusions (e.g., slavery).But can you? Aristotle’s opening salvo in his Politics evidence that the two are hopelessly intertwined: teleology just shifts the argument from deciding on what is moral to deciding on what something’s purpose is. And if you get the purpose of something wrong (e.g, the natural function of some people is to be slaves), then you end up with a bad value (slavery is OK).I laughed when Aristotle went from suggesting his own crazy ideas (slavery is natural, women are not equal to men, finance is evil) to pointing out how nuts Plato’s own ideas were in his “Republic” (they were!). Further, Aristotle’s reputation for thorough categorization frequently comes across as pedantic (e.g.,. “The members of a state must either have all things or nothing in common, or somethings in common and some not”). Perhaps my problem with the book was that half of the points he was making were so universally agreed upon today as to be benign, so all that’s left is to notice the howlers. I suppose this is just a reflection of his enormous influence – that his ideas are now so commonly held as to be rendered uninteresting.This book was actually much more interesting as a historical document. For example, Aristotle has some interesting proto ideas that lead towards today’s understanding of the Rule of Law: “… laws, when good, should be supreme; and that the magistrate or magistrates should regulate those maters only on which the laws are unable to speak with precision owing to the difficulty of any general principle embracing all particulars.” And elsewhere “… those who have any complaint to bring against the magistrates say, ‘let the people be judges’; the people are happy to accept the invitation; and so the authority of every office is undermined. Such a democracy is fairly open to the objection that it is not a constitution at all; for where the laws have no authority, there is no constitution. The law ought to be supreme over all, and the magistracies should judge the particulars, and only this should be considered a constitution. Embedded in the latter quote is a value judgment about democracy that needs some unpacking. Aristotle defines democracy as the negative manifestation of governments ruling in the interest of the needy majority, sometimes controlled by a demagogue, while constitutional governments are the same but with more balance towards a common good. Characterizing these various forms of government (kingship/tyranny, aristocracy/oligarchy, constitutional government / democracy) takes up the majority of the book.Another example is finding passages that I suspect were also read and underlined by America’s founding fathers, such as:…democracy and demos in their truest form are based upon the recognized principle of democratic justice, that all should count equally; for equality implies that the poor should have no more share in the government than the rich, and should not only be rulers, but that all should rule equally according to their numbers.This was an idea hotly debated, for example, during the Three-Fifths Compromise.One final example, I’m reading Hobbes’s “Leviathan” in parallel, and was excited to come across a passage that he referenced directly:The fact is, that the greatest crimes are caused by excess and not by necessity. Men do not become tyrants in order that they may not suffer cold; and hence great is the honor bestowed, not on him who kills a thief, but on him who kills a tyrant.

28,Ian Caveny,"Back in June, I started Aristotle's famous discourse on politics, but it was either not the right time or the right season. I couldn't quite get into the swing of thingsSo, when I approached the text again in early October of this year, I thought I may be getting myself again into the hot water of ""books that are going to take more time out of me than I'd like them to."" I was gladly reproved. I don't know what constitutes the ""appropriate reading season"" for the Politics, but for me it was entering into full-time pastoral ministry that has most helped me to finally read a classic of the art of governance. One might ask ""Why this combination?"" and to that I would respond: ""There seems to be a significant relationship between the efficient organization of the city (polis) in Aristotle's work and the efficient organization of the polity of the local Church."" Indeed, the strange similarities between Aristotle's critical-exegetical insights of the functioning of the City and the role of a pastor who ought to critically-exegete the functions of the local Church has fueled much of my reading this fall and served as a practical outlet for the knowledge gained in this reading. (I even wrote an essay for some of these practical responses to Aristotle: here.)Aristotle is a fun ancient Greek to read. I really do mean this. Sometimes right after a brilliant breakdown of political structures he will toss up some analysis of how to keep one's slaves happy, or the place of the woman in the home, or why the Phrygian mode is less educational than the Dorian mode, and you, the modern reader, just has to laugh. Maybe Aristotle gives us a sense of humility: come two thousand plus years, our thoughts too will both inspire and humor our fourth millennia audiences.The Politics is rightly understood to be a foundational text for understanding politics (of course), governance, and the like. There's a sense, as I read the Politics, that our American political world could be far-simplified if simply every senator and representative were required to read Aristotle prior to his or her oath of office. It would have the power to re-frame debate and discourse; we could see our two-party system as a balance between those who pretend to be oligarchs and those who pretend to be democrats (and who, in reality, are both both of those things). Moreover, it would remind us that all good cities, in order to prosper, must target themselves at a good end (telos).There are many other reasons to read the Politics, but they can all be summed up, perhaps, in one sentence: This argument is the foundational undergirding of most of the greatest arguments of the history of Western civilization. Without the Politics there is, in theology, no City of God and, thus, no Two Kingdoms; without the Politics there is, in philosophy, no Hegelian dialectic (founded upon the master-bondsman discourse early in the text) and, thus, no Marxist dialectic (founded upon the first half of the book); without the Politics there is, in history and politics, no American Constitution. Thus, it is so surprising that I am so late in my education to read even just a part of it. It seems to me that all these above texts are, for better and for worse, incomprehensible without reading their sourcetext. It would be like reading Paul's Letter to the Romans apart from the Book of Genesis. The context is crucial.As such, I heartily endorse the reading of Aristotle. He is a good antidote to the idealistic temperaments of our age, even if he, at times, makes one laugh at his idiosyncrasies. At the end of the day, his core arguments - about telos and about the polis - are the foundations of most of our academic and day-to-day thought, and we would be fools not to seek understanding of our own foundations.

29,Lanko,"There's so much to say about this book that would take probably many hours to properly do it. Maybe I will do it later.As for the book, it's both inspiring and depressing. Inspiring in the sense that there's someone who experimented and knows about issues that even today and were debated and studied since his time. Depressing in the sense that when you read his words on everything that can go wrong on a government we actually realize more than 2500 years later we as humans didn't actually changed at all (Aristotle was born in 384 B.C and also gives examples of decades/centuries before).He may place too much emphasis on the State, but considering his time, it's not surprising. Populations were really small, continents had vast amounts of empty areas, harsh conditions and sickness. No wonder he placed so much value on the State to bring people together.But he also didn't exactly forget about individualism. One of the most curious chapters is when he discusses Plato's Republic, an idea of Socrates of so much coletivism that even wives and children would be shared among everyone.To think that Aristotle actually had to work years to actually seriously write a whole chapter to totally refute this Socrates' concept of State (and that the idea was even conceived and taken seriously in the first place) seems laughable.But then we look what all sides on the political spectrum pretty much in every country are actually discussing...Aristotle has views on slavery that of course wouldn't be accepted today. But more than 2000 years after his writings we still needed major wars to decide if slavery was legal or not, things like Apartheid and even today slavery exists in some corners of the Earth. Aristotle has views on women being mostly passive in society. Same thing. We have entire countries that do much worse to them and our elected leaders turn a blind eye if they a convenient economic treaty.Aristotle disdains the manual worker. But does our society views them that differently today?When those passages appeared and I thought ""Well, today is different, this is from your time"", a few seconds later those considerations popped in. So do we, overall as a society really can claim the moral ground to criticize the man when even leaders elected by ourselves turn a blind eye to the problems above?This makes one feel small when considering the vast amount of time that passed from his age to ours. Yes, we had changes, but little changed in the essence of things.He also makes some mistakes. For example, he says that the people, when grouped, is less susceptible to demagogy and its dangers. Maybe it was true in his time, where cities and countries were really small and you knew pretty much everyone in it. You saw those people every day and thus could see daily their true behavior and make a judgement of it if they decided to do a public political speech and had to do it in front of everyone.The vastness countries assumed today would certainly astound Aristotle. All we know from people wanting power is really what THEY want us to know and what their ENEMIES wants us to know, both with possibilities of being lies. Add to that PR, TV, radio, etc.Anyway, it's pretty clear that vast crowds are exactly where people get too emotional and less rational, without a doubt. That's how the worst demagogues came and still come to power. In vast crowds the individual easily becomes a sheep.There's also a chapter on how monarchs fall. Machiavelli talked about hate and disdain for the ruler and whether to be feared and loved and examples. He needed a whole book for that. Aristotle did it in a single chapter. Almost 2000 years before too.I think it's enough. No wonder the man was/is one of the most influential people of all time.
