0,Scott Holstad,"Doesn't live up to his reputation. But then, many feel he himself didn't live up to his reputation (nor Plato). I believe many scholars have determined Democritus (with Leucippus) to be far more influential, accurate, knowledgeable, possibly more intelligent (certainly than Plato) and diverse, among other things. Noted virtually universally as ""father of modern science,"" through Leucippus's influence, he is often thought to be the first physicist, as he is typically credited for his formulation of an (detailed) atomic theory for the universe. In fact, his atomic hypothesis was developed to such a degree, and unlike anything else at the time, bore a resemblance to modern science and one could essentially argue that what we know, or learned, about atomics in the twentieth century was directly influenced by Democritus' atomic theory, which in many ways remains the basis for current atomic physics. Moreover, he dabbled and proved influential in a number of other areas, ranging from geometry specifically and math in general to geography and anthropology to the importance and essence of epistemology to scientific aesthetics to politics and natural philosophy (of course), where he seemed especially concerned with the subject of ethics, to military tactics as well as cosmology, poetry, biology and many, many more subjects -- really the first true Renaissance man. Really kind of puts some better known philosophers to shame (not that some weren't also geniuses -- it's just that many people can't find many in history, and virtually none before Democritus to explore and master such a wide variety of subjects. Indeed, his ""void"" thesis lived on to influence Newton and continued to hold that influence basically until Einstein). However, regarding this book by Aristotle, while this was a subject he was well versed in and despite this book being a bit dated, it was still fairly well done for the times, had some good ideas, thoughts, points, etc. Unfortunately, there's always been some controversy surrounding it due to some textual irregularities and discrepancies in some of the eight ""books"" making up this book, or rather what remains of them. (Some of the major topics among these different books include ideas about community, citizenship, regimes, education, constitutions and political theory, among others.) However, this to the point that some have argued the book represents seemingly two different versions, or perhaps stages, in Aristotle's thoughts, beliefs, positions, etc., and the two opposing sides seem so varied, almost oppositional, that IF Aristotle even wrote the entire thing himself, it's likely he would have done so over a long period of time, so that a significant period of time elapsed between the first and later sections, thus explaining its inconsistencies and, one might say, possibly two different belief systems. Thus, I'm only giving it two stars because even though it might otherwise merit three at least, the problems noted make it difficult to have confidence regarding sufficient authenticity, consistency and more, and frankly results in a poor book in its known form and hence one of his lesser works. As a result, not recommended.

1,Brandon,"This book gave me a lot to think about and I would like to return to it after reading Plato's Republic, since a lot of it hinges on a criticism of that book. One thing I did not expect was that there is a lot of history and description of actual regimes in this book. There were many anecdotes from Greek politics, many interesting and some even amusing, but the historical section of the book got somewhat tedious because I was looking more for his theory of government. It's not until the last two chapters where Aristotle says what he thinks it the best type of government, and I found this part to be the most interesting. The entire last chapter is about education, and much of it about music education. I get the impression that Aristotle liked music.Much is made of how slavery is so central to Aristotle's argument. If one considers our modern equivalent of slave labor is automation and robotics, then those who would view politics as mere ""social engineering"" - perhaps you may call them technocrats - in a way are trying to simplify politics into mastery. To Aristotle this is unacceptable, because proper rule is between equals. In this understanding, his contention that proper rule is not an extrapolation of mastery is still applicable to today even though we find human slavery deplorable. One thing I disagreed with him on was that people who are capable of self-rule need to have an abundance in leisure. In fact, while in describing the nature of regimes he states that democracy works best when it is made up of farmers, because they have their own business to attend to and only make laws that are really needed. But in the section on his ideal regime, he says that ideally all the farming is done by slaves, so that the ruling class can have idle leisure. I think this is very similar to our current historical situation in the developed world, where farming is done by giant machines far away, and everyone has a lot of leisure time - yet our politics seems to be much more dysfunctional than when people were more self-sufficient. Aristotle does acknowledge that too much leisure and luxury can weaken successive generations, and he emphasizes the education in the virtues as the remedy for this. Maybe there is something to this, or maybe it is just that those effete artsy Greek's don't see the value in good old-fashioned hard work.

2,Noah McMillen,"Listened to the audiobook. Favorite quotes:“Let us remember that we should not disregard the experience of ages; in the multitude of years these things, if they were good, would certainly not have been unknown; for almost everything has been found out, although sometimes they are not put together; in other cases men do not use the knowledge which they have” (Book II).“But we must remember that good laws, if they are not obeyed, do not constitute good government. Hence there are two parts of good government; one is the actual obedience of citizens to the laws, the other part is the goodness of the laws which they obey; they may obey bad laws as well as good” (Book IV).“The mean condition of states is clearly best, for no other is free from faction; and where the middle class is large, there are least likely to be factions and dissensions. For a similar reason large states are less liable to faction than small ones, because in them the middle class is large; whereas in small states it is easy to divide all the citizens into two classes who are either rich or poor, and to leave nothing in the middle. And democracies are safer and more permanent than oligarchies, because they have a middle class which is more numerous and has a greater share in the government; for when there is no middle class, and the poor greatly exceed in number, troubles arise, and the state soon comes to an end” (Book IV).“For two principles are characteristic of democracy, the government of the majority and freedom. Men think that what is just is equal; and that equality is the supremacy of the popular will; and that freedom means the doing what a man likes. In such democracies everyone lives as he pleases, or in the words of Euripides, 'according to his fancy.' But this is all wrong; men should not think it slavery to live according to the rule of the constitution; for it is their salvation” (Book V).“Every man should be responsible to others, nor should any one be allowed to do just as he pleases; for where absolute freedom is allowed, there is nothing to restrain the evil which is inherent in every man. But the principle of responsibility secures that which is the greatest good in states; the right persons rule and are prevented from doing wrong, and the people have their due” (Book VI).

3,Xenophon,"Carnes Lord's translation of Politics reminded me of how philosophy is one part the Author's insights/reasoning and another part the student's reaction. I slowly chewed this text over the course of a few months because I wanted to wrestle with Aristotle as a reasonably educated man rather than take the text in as. The old man delivered. A few piecemeal insights- first, this is a continuation of Nichomachean Ethics. They can both be seen as one large lecture series. Politics delves into the communal ramifications of the previous course and couples it with fresh insights and a load of historical references. Indeed, unless you are an expert in Mediterranean history between 500BC and 300BC, you'll need a text with good notes and a lot of patience. This University of Chicago edition does that just fine. Second, this is a foundation text of Western philosophy. Like all others of its kind, it records the thoughts of a true genius. A man who sat around and thought through every aspect of existence. He is far from right in all things, but even where the reader finds him wrong, they will find something familiar backed up with a stone wall of reasoning. Westerners have been talking back and forth with Aristotle for a long, long time. As such, there are books that I think are more profitable for the modern reader- books with similar (if not better) insights, but more navigable language, and more readily grasped historical references. But can you call yourself truly educated if you have never given the OG a try? It's like calling yourself an expert in film without knowing Citizen Kane. I would write more if I had the time for it, but suffice it to say, this is an essential. I only deducted a star because I enjoyed the Carnes Lord translation a little less than the other Aristotle translations I have read. Maybe one day Robert C. Bartlett will crank one out. If and when he does, I'll be ready to give the sage of logic another try. Hopefully a better historical background.

4,Jakub Ferencik,"Plato originally suggested that the elites can best rule over the people. Plato argued that cardinal virtues guide the elite, the philosopher-kings, which is why they take rule since they set away earthly desires. Aristotle dismissed this idea because he believed it ignored human nature. For Aristotle, a conception of human nature, as seen in Plato's Republic, ignored the importance of providing citizens, even the elite philosopher-kings, the mundane pleasures of life. We should pay attention to the goods of the body because we have human bodies that need our basic appetites, such as hunger and thirst, fulfilled.On the contrary, Aristotle thought that each citizen is best able to achieve ultimate happiness or eudaimonia when they pursue excellence in character. According to Aristotle, virtue is the middle path between the two extremes of vices, as he outlines in the Nicomachean Ethics (30). I discussed this concept in my review on that book. In Aristotle's polity, the rulers and ruled take turns in governing. The leading cause of revolution, Aristotle argued, is preventing an exchange of rule by not treating each citizen equally. Oligarchical regimes, Aristotle writes, are based on the presupposition that unequal citizens in one way are unequal in every way (Politics 187). Therefore, the oligarchical ""superiority,"" Aristotle argued, is the ultimate cause of revolution (191). ""Disproportion"" occurs when in a state that has many parts, one part grows exponentially where the others do not (193). We can see this throughout history: either when Romanian citizens in 1989, overthrew Nicolae Ceaușescu's government and shot the dictator and his wife or when the angry french mob decapitated Louis XVI during the French Revolution. Aristotle's predictions for revolt as a result of the unequal nature of oligarchies were correct. .

5,Aiden,"Interesting read, obviously relations between master and slave or man to woman are expressed in an outdated manner suited to classical antiquity, but particular highlights are the discussion on the best constitution and the seeming preference being aristocracy not in the sense of an extension of oligarchy but as a sort of meritocracy. Certainly one can read this and see how deeply it influences western thought. The notion that there are different levels to the four forms of constitution - democracy, monarchy, oligarchy, aristocracy - in that you can be too democratic, too oligarchic, that the prosperity and involvement of the middle class in a society as a mediator between the contending forces of rich and poor is best; that the poor in power will destroy the rich; that the rich in power will neglect the poor; that society’s happiness and well-being must be measured not against one particular section of the state but across all its members. Apply this thought to contrasting examples of communism - which if we look at China has a more oligarchic format in terms of being a democracy where the people are nominally rulers but the party there rule - liberal democracy where nominally people rule but within Britain more often than not the conservatives representing oligarchic interests of the aristocracy, monarchy and better off enjoy more or less sustained hegemony throughout British history.All in all pertinent questions raised that remain relevant today, to be too democratic means a weak state and an inability to action, not being democratic enough tends to tyranny and failure of the role of the state to safeguard the population - so dust off the republic and build a new constitutional utopia taking the best parts of what Aristotle outlines in this book...good luck.

6,Nick Paulter,"Politics, AristotleAn often redundant discussion, and with many examples that are somewhat historically inconsequential, but, interestingly, the government types he describes about 2500 years ago still exist, still dysfunction in nominally the same ways, still (mis)treat people in the same ways, and still transform from one to another for the same reasons. Tyrants come to power for the same reasons, people become complacent or disinterested for the same reasons, and revolutions occur for the same reasons. The examples he provides from the ancient Greek world and environs could have just as well been taken from our world during the last couple of decades. Aristotle describes the parts of a government that are basic, namely a deliberative body, a judicial body, and executors/administrators, similar to what most states have today (although execution may not be ideal). He describes the need of a welfare system to promote and teach self-sufficiency in the population, a state-sponsored educational system, etc., all of which are part of most modern societies. I thought it was remarkable, perhaps from a naïve sociopolitical perspective (of which mine is limited), that nothing has changed significantly in a political sense over the last two millennia. Interestingly, he makes a suggestion for marriage: 37 years for the man and 18 yrs for the woman, and to be wed nominally in the winter. I got the season and age difference right (although not the actual age), perhaps that’s a reason my marriage is lasting.

7,Aristotle,"The Politics by AristotleA book best left to the classrooms. Aristotle’s Politics is a sometimes interesting, mostly garishly boring book composed over two millennia ago. Some of it still holds up today, some of it really does not. It’s difficult to judge books that are so old but I’ll do my best to offer my thoughts on it.For one, it’s exhausting. It took me almost three months to finish this book, whereas similar sized books could be finished in under a week. Unless you are seriously invested in Greek/Classic philosophy and/or political analysis, I’d advise staying away. I had experienced Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics before this a few years back but it appears that these are two very different pieces.Secondly, it is rather well rooted in it’s time. For example, Aristotle not only believes in slavery but justifies it. This isn’t a wholehearted negative if you’re interested in exactly how they did in fact justify slavery, but otherwise the reader will be constantly held up by how often this piece does not connect well with our lives today.On the other hand, where Aristotle does do proper political analysis that is disconnected from his period, the book shines. These parts were my favorite to read and is an example of good philosophy. I also liked how Aristotle’s use of far more empirical evidence than his contemporaries gave his arguments more bite.Overall, the Politics is an interesting look into the world of 4th century BC politics and thinking. Aristotle articulates himself in a way not unlike ourselves, but his world is distinctly different to ours. But as they say history doesn’t repeat, it rhymes. This is a short review because even thinking about the book now makes me tired, so I’ll be happy to move on to more modern philosophers, or perhaps no philosophy at all for a little while. I’m leaving it with a 5/10.

8,Tom,"Read the classics, you won’t find a balm in Gilead for whatever ails you in this day and age but you’ll certainly find here's nothing new under the sun. It’s always been a bonehead move to base ones entire ethico-political system on an assumed and self justifying natural hierarchy. Imagine you live in a democratic society with people who are poor and people who are wealthy, the wealthy exist within a position that allows them to further amass political and economic power, inequity worsens as they govern for themselves, outrage follows. Your democracy has become an oligarchy, tyranny reigns.The intelligentsia tell you to sit back and a) hold out for a messianic class of virtuous political actors to guide you to a promised pragmatic land, b) it won’t happen again if we’re all more virtuous next time, c) do both but by g-d! don’t change a thing that mightn’t be natural! Reform happens but the fundamental basis of the system doesn’t change. The situation inevitably regresses. Rinse, repeat, ad nauseam.That situation is today, yesterday, and ancient history. lt’s the sum of all the wisdom held in the pages of this book. The Politics is not a political manual, it’s a social tragedy. Aristotle and colleagues were able to see what was going wrong but lacked the (academic) virtue to escape Grecian teleology. A fault modern readers, one hopes, can themselves overcome. Read the classics, stop living them.

9,Lori,"Yet another classic that was cherry-picked into oblivion in order to justify just about anything. But unlike Plato, Aristotle uses a better way of analysing human society, that of organic growth rather than pure linearly analytical. Lewis Mumford in ""The City in History"" (p. 184) puts it best:Yet just because Aristotle's philosophy was basically that of a biologist, rather than a mathematician, he brought to the discussion of cities something that Plato lacked: a knowledge of the immense variety of species and an appreciation of the endless creative manifestations of life itself. With this came an understanding of the teleological, goal-seeking, self-actualizing nature of all organisms, and of the natural limits that define normal growth. For Aristotle, the ideal was not a rationally abstract form to be arbitrarily imposed on the community: it was rather a form already potential in the very nature of the species, needing only to be brought out and developed.While the developmental, organic metaphor might be a better way of thinking about human society, that does not excuse some absurd conclusions like the justification of slavery or sexism. Aristotle is the prime example of having human prejudices projected onto nature, and then using that projection to justify the initial prejudice as natural.

10,Tyler Storm,"I read the Alan Wardman translation of books 1-3 and supplemented with the Ernest Barker translations from a separate book that I own (Oxford world classics version). I primarily used the selections provided in the Signet Classics Philosophy of Aristotle book. His ideas here are pretty revolutionary given the time period. He also responds to various theories promulgated by Socrates and Plato. You need to have some background knowledge to fully grasp the book but his views are widely adopted today. The introductions of the Oxford world classics book and Signet Classics book was helpful though. The Oxford version contains substantially more background information and detail which I will revisit in 2021. I'll have to reread portions of this book that were not included in the Signet Classic selections sometime in the future. Pretty good read though.The Oxford world classic featuring the translation from Ernest Barker is light years ahead of the Signet Classic version. I only bought the latter because it had several of Aristotle's works (selections only) and was selling at a cheap price of $8 as opposed to $16 for just one of Aristotle's works. I was fortunate to get a copy of the Oxford world classic version of Politics at a goodwill for a dollar or two. I'll be using this copy when rereading Politics

11,Neil Johnstone,"An amazing book, should be read in every school im sure it is at posh schools because as aristotle says the education for the ruler and the ruled must be different. He writes about the perfect state the differences of democracy, oligarchy and tyranny and also says that the long lasting states are a mixture of democracy and oligarchy and can be described as both.He would say that 90% of us are not citizens (subjects) and therefore shouldn't vote of matters of the state because only statesmen have that right or super wealthy. Loads of passages why social or making things equal in wealth and property doesn't work simply put humans get comfortable and then want more cuz we are idiots.Amazing to think this was written 3000 years ago and we are still in these same cycles or could with depressing that we are still doing this.Talks about education and eugenics and keeping the population down to two children probably not a bad idea but seems cold also he'd kill me and my crip brothers so aristotle bit of a bastard but trying to find the reason for a state to help people like me still grappling.It is always the weaker who go in search of justice and equality; the stronger reck nothing of them.

12,Kevin,"This one is really difficult to review but I'll try. Do I agree with Aristotle? Mostly not, but partially for lack of a solid knowledge base about Ancient Greece, and partially because I don't find slavery to be a natural condition and don't believe women to be inferior. I'm glad I read Plato's Republic before this one and I wish I had read Plato's Laws and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics before this as well, among other general histories. That aside, did he make me think? Certainly. The idea that constitutions , ideal constitutions for specific states, should be different and likely shifting, according to conditions at the time is a interesting thought. Was our constitution the best possible constitution when it was written (during an agrarian society)? Does our constitution represent the best constitution we could have now (for a highly industrialized and technological society)? Interesting to think about. This is by no means an easy book to read, partially because it probably was never meant to a book, as such. The 1/3 editor's notes and 2/3 Aristotle writings was a good mix. I'd like to come back to this in a decade or two, for now i'd say it's a thought provoking & difficult read.

13,Mauricio Garcia,"I find it bizarre that readers acknowledge that the world (civilization) of Aristotle is not the world that we live in today, but use that as a justification to hold our current political system and specially values as inherently ""right"". I don't know if they understand that in doing so they act in the same authoritative way as Plato and Aristotle did at their time, —and surely if humans from 2500 years in the future could read their reviews and find out our current political and morals stands (in all its spectrum) they'd be dismissive of them as well.My point being that it shouldn't be the most important aspect of this Essay wether or not it aligns with current thinking.As for the book itself, it is an interesting read for anyone remotely interested in political systems, even if, as is usual with Aristotle, his encyclopaedic categorization and analysis is more of value as an historical curiosity than of practical implementation: a window to the relationship between Greco-Roman and Western societies as a more 'perfected' successor (more just? equitable? """"""humane""""""?) regarding their rule and form of government.

Hope to tackle Metaphysics and Physics, as well.Again, it is kind of silly to give a rating to Aristotle, but my rating is a nod to the edition. For each chapter of The Politics, Trevor Saunders provides a brief introduction and overview of what is to come, often providing historical context as well as insights into how the Greek has been translated. Extremely useful for tackling the text itself.Meanwhile, reading Aristotle was a surprisingly startling experience for me both for how relevant many of his observations are to today's political landscape, but also how different his world and many of the things he took for granted were (see for instance his discussion of slavery). His writing is very accessible with very little in terms of complicated philosophical jargon. Saunders is helpful in guiding the first time reader through Aristotle's larger themes, such as his teleological take on the world, without getting mired in the centuries of debate that have surrounded these ideas.Well worth the effort!

15,Bogdan,"Although an arduous read at times, I'm glad I pushed through some of the difficult parts and managed to finish this book. I found Aristotle's classification of constitutions not only as relevant as ever, but actually universally. Every state that ever existed and will exist will invariably fall under one - or more likely several - of the 6 forms of government described in the book: tyranny, monarchy, oligarchy, aristocracy, democracy, constitutional government.What I found remarkable, especially compared to Plato's Republic, is the inductive method Aristotle uses. He looks at many of the city states of his time and before his time, and compares the different constitutions and their relative success. From these real life data points, he draws conclusions as to which are the best constitutions for different types of city states. Aristotle really did put the ""science"" in ""political science"".It's definitely not an easy read and I'm deducting 1 star for the long and vague passages around the mid section of the book, but I would highly recommend it to anyone the least bit interested in politics.

16,Daniel Triumph,"Look, I have a preference for Plato over Aristotle. Plato wrote dialogues, and Aristotle more or less wrote textbooks. Plato tried to discover and theorize and had an open but almost charming bias for philosophers. Aristotle tries to be objective, but while some of Plato's ideas are progressive even for our time, much of Aristotle's assumptions are stuck in ancient Athens.Aristotle is great and vital for any student of science or philosophy. But, he spends a lot more time describing things than creating and arguing philosophical theories. The Politics, I fear, is not very important any longer. Where it does shine, and where it takes my attention is his criticism of Plato's idea of having women and children in commen. It was a strange and poorly supported part of the Republic, and Aristotle rightly argues that it is likely irrelevant to a good state, and worse, potentially destructive to it. The commentary on Plato was the best then. You can see I'm biased, but perhaps my point is still understandable and valid despite it.

17,Raymond Raad,"This book is surprisingly good, and in a sense it is modern too. He poses many of the same questions that arise today in forming a political order. His influence on the founding fathers is obvious as well. Essentially Aristotle is trying to solve the problem of how a large number of people can live together most productively. He has an individualist perspective - the fundamental unit of society is the individual and the nuclear family. He ultimately favors a type of limited democracy but is aware of the ways it can lead to tyranny. So he moderates it through the rule of law, through an active and large middle class, and through some oligarchic elements. He is concerned that each strata of society has enough of a role. He is also concerned that the meritorious have a role in the society, and struggles to ensure that they have a role through moderation. Seems to me that today, Aristotle would support a strong congress, the electoral college, and federalism as moderating forces.

18,Yousef M,"Aristotle's Ethics about virtue and how to live a good life is really a setup for the Politics such that they can be considered parts 1 and 2 of a larger book. Politics is derived from ""polis"" the Greek word for city, which was seen as an ideal community in which human beings could flourish and informs Aristotle's investigation. He goes into advantages and weaknesses of different constitutions and regimes (particularly focusing on monarchy, oligarchy, and democracy), comparisons of how a city-state should be run relative to a household or even marriage, what constitutes a citizen, and the education of a city-state to ensure it's prosperity. It can get a bit tedious at times (and perhaps I am feeling Ancient Greek philosophy-fatigue), but no one can deny Aristotle's incisive analysis and his honesty in questioning his own preconceived notions. What makes Aristotle's writings so special is his comfort in leaving the reader without a clear answer but plenty of legitimate viewpoints.

For me, the interest of ancients systems on ancient terms are rather lame, but there was still from time to times parts that were very interesting to read. I would say the three last books are the best out of them all. As for Aristotle, we can see he uses the ideas developed in earlier works while exploring politics, but it seems to me that this part is less cut in stone - less assured and much more of a time-sensitive matter. Politics change more than virtues, logic or even ethics. Everything considered I'm glad that I finally got to this book, even if it took its toll to read.

While reading the works of Aristotle, it is easy to feel that you are reading a scientific textbook aimed to inform the reader of main ideas and arguments, you cannot feel any emotions or feelings while reading, and the writer obviously was just regarding the issue as a phenomenon worth studying and observing, this is what marks Aristotle as a pillar of western philosophy. The benefit of this book thus lies in its informative nature, not the most entertaining of books for sure, but definitely a place of leisure for the minds searching for knowledge and direct information.

He analyzes the household as a constituent part of the ""polis."" He makes recommendations for preserving a functional constitution, through education and promotion of the Virtues.

Aristotle imitates his former teacher and writes about what he believes makes a perfect government and, in doing so, dedicates a couple of chapters to criticize The Republic.Puting aside the very lamentable chapters in favor of slavery, the rest of the book provides a great inside of how little we have advance on the topic in the last 2000 years, and how much influence this book has had in western civilization.The author provides countless examples from history to support his claims that shows that the lessons he conveys to the reader were already old and well know even in his time.

28,Joseph Raborg,"People don’t think that old books have anything to say to them; but, if there is one thing that Aristotle’s politics prove is that the core issues of government don’t change. His methods for a tyranny to protect its own power are still used to this day. (A few eerily mirror some features about modern American life in the past forty years.) I was surprised when he said that the surest way to make a monarchy permanent is by limiting the power of the king, which we see in so many European countries. Aristotle even points out the problems of communism! Simply put, if you want to really understand modern politics, you must read this 4th century BC treatise on the subject.

29,Daniel Sanderson,"A Treatise on Government is a fundamental philosophical text that will serve anyone interested in the history of political discussion and the merits of different forms of government. Being familiar with the work would prove very useful in a variety of political debates about the formation of the United States as it provides context for many aspects of the American government.Outside of the political realm, his ethics have gained renewed interest as a result of the modern advent of virtue ethics. However, all aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.
