0,Artyom Grigoryan,"ζῷον πoλιτικόνUndoubtedly, this is one of the most important works of ancient Greek philosophy, which describes in detail the political and state structure of Ancient Greece. Aristotle goals to find a formula of an ideal system.However, nowadays, this narrative, at least to me, seems very aggressive: war instead of peace; slavery, sexism and membership in 'noble' parties instead of equality. To be ruled without the right to make your own decisions.Today, for such thoughts, people at least will unfollow or unfriend on social networks... However, before Christ, this was a way of thinking of the greatest philosophers.

1,Nicholas,"It's such a shame that we don't have Aristotle's original dialogues... Politics, like his other works, is at times incoherent and at other times profound. Most of the time, however, it is absurdly boring. Aristotle takes a very taxonomic approach to political philosophy by attempting to categorize every permutation of governmental system and explain their methods of governance. This gets old very quickly, but all in all it's not incomprehensible; approach with caution and some caffeine for the middle chunk.Also side note: Aristotle's critiques of Plato's Republic and Laws are terribly argued.

2,bookaholic,"I'm not reading fun stuff since I gotta study for my midterms but LET ME TELL YOU Aristoteles is SUPER cancelled for thinking poor people are not good enough to be an important part of the state and hello?? Women are great so stop bashing is and acting like the world would go down if we had something to say! It is a very accessible read and it honestly really got me into reading non-fiction but Sparta was more progressive and go criticised by this douch bag sooo 3 stars. If he would still be leaving I'd only give him one star but he just wasn't then his times and I can't blame him that much I guess.

3,Denis Kovalev,"Hard to rate such a classic book that on the one hand is closely tied to the life perception of that era and on the other hand is so thoughtful, clean and contains the ideas that were preserved through the centuries almost intact.This is a must-read for those interested in politics, social order and interactions between the citizens and the country. It discloses what it means to be a citizen, what political systems exist and why. Aristotle as a master of human nature analyses what it means to be happy and how people can achieve it being in a group and forming and belonging to a country.

4,Elizabeth Jennings,"Valuable and careful thinking about what it means to be a citizen and what kinds of regime are best. The biggest takeaway for me was that being a ""good citizen"" is not the same as being a virtuous person--in a ""deviant regime,"" a ""good citizen"" is actually a bad person! Giving four stars because the presentation style is so dry it really takes the motivation of reading with a group to get through it. Fortunately I had an excellent group to read this with, at summer classics at St. John's College.

5,Jayme,"I...did not like this book. As other reviewers have noted, it's hard to review a classic, much less a foundational text. But while I can appreciate the project of this book and much of its execution, most of it was not particularly edifying, and a good half of it quite hard to get through. My favorite sections were in the middle, when different government systems (democracy vs oligarchy etc.) were discussed. I learned something new that I could apply to my thinking about nations today. But I feel like I wasted a fair bit of time to get there.

6,Justin,"A surprisingly relevant ancient account of politics including the importance of constitutional authority, the influence of money in politics, demagoguery, and the education of citizens. Some insights include that the more that money influences politics, the closer it is to oligarchy (political rights proportionate to wealth), rather than equality of rights for all (democracy). Aristotle asserts that those who promote virtue deserve the greatest share of power. How to make this happen relies on the education of the citizens who support such individuals.

7,Eli,"Sage. Fascinating. In contrast to the abstract, idealistic, and impractical Republic of Plato, Aristotle thinks about politics with his feet firmly planted on the ground. His rooting of government in nature and family agrees with the Bible. Aristotle suggests that there are several legitimate forms of government, which can each work, provided that citizens are virtuous and leaders are wise. There is much to learn from here. It is a wonder this is not more widely read, since so many simply political blunders would be exposed and avoided.

8,Amelia,"does seeing the words and turning the pages count as reading bc what was this man saying 80% of the time. he b like “that by which can be two that i have already described is one which was mentioned” ?? yo???i feel weird reviewing classical texts that are extensively debated but tbh this one’s warranted bc i found his arguments to be pretty weak or just not substantiated enough. plato does the same through socrates in the republic, but you can read that one as a critique of socrates’ manner of arguing. you can’t really read this from a more nuanced/literary perspective like you can in the republic to approach it more generously, either. also he’s like women & slaves r stinky and stupid so i’m taking stars off to be petty i bet he’s shaking and crying in hell like “noooo amelia from goodreads gave me 2 stars and said my book was bad :,(“

9,Jason,"Master/slave hierarchy relationships benefit the state or city? Aristotle, considered to be a master at formal logic, shows his weakness in reasoning, by assuming it to be just for the ""greater to rule the lesser."" I understand his approach in city/state operation rule for the ""Greek to be better than the barbarian"" because of the system of government, his fallacy; however, is all men are flawed in regards to character.

10,Jim,"Some reviewers express the difficulty of critiquing something like this. In my reviews of the classics, I've said very little about the authors or the books. Instead, I spoke about my ability, or lack thereof, to read and understand what I thought the author wanted to convey. Take heart fellow readers! Reading and understanding the classics does get easier the more you do it. So keep trying! The rewards are great!

11,Kristopher Driver,"Profound if one can suspend modern views of words like ""slavery"", since most think first of the Anglo American slave trade model rather than the predominant Roman model of the time (for example). It's chillingly thought provoking even in spite of the monumental shifts in social organization and collective norms evolved since then by way of surplus, medicine and the excesses reaped today via technology.

12,Federico,"A classic and a must read of western civilization literature. Aristotle shares his concepts on governance through the application of politics to societies. A refresh from primary school teachings on democracy and governance while also digging profoundly and deeply into the framework, categories and criteria of the systems of governance according to Aristotle, their pros and cons. Using examples of his time.",really liked it
13,Richard,"The views in here on servitude and slavery are obviously antiquated and immoral, Aristotle's opinions about marriage and child bearing are quaint and kind of silly, but his views offer perspective for the time in which he lived.With that said, there are some principles that can be drawn away when it comes to having a civil society under a good form of government. The key to this, however, is that the citizenry live by virtuous principles.

14,Blake Hiatt,"I'm giving this book 5 stars, because it is obvious the Founding Fathers of the US were conversant with Aristotle. In fact, the Founders probably read it in the original Greek.However, the book is a bit of a slog to get through, and, while I found Aristotles observations on government to be astute, I found his prescriptions for how society should be ordered to be tedious.With that, I still recommend reading this book.

15,Dvdlynch,"Oxford World Classics did a bang up job on this edition of the Politics. The text is divided into sections of related chapters. Each chapter has been provided with a brief paragraph that summarizes the contents of said chapter. The introduction and notes do an excellent job of pointing out where different sections of the text overlap in content. Reading Aristotle probably can't get much easier.

16,Eric Guzman,"This is a book you read when you want to understand how people 2500 years ago thought.It is an analysis of the books that Aristotle wrote about politics. One can appreciate the political organization of the cities primitive state and to some extent is interesting, but there are more contemporary books that better explain the same theme.",liked it
17,Daniel Nelms,"What else could be said? Great book. Another one that deserves a second and third deep read. If you can set aside his obvious sexism, and understand the nature of his discussion of slavery (that has nothing to do with race or nationality, but rather nature) there is much to be learned and challenged by. The chapters in the various regimes are so helpful. ",really liked it
18,Malcolm Stewart,"Any politics nerd should probably pick up this book and, at least, try to read it. I say ‘try’ because it took me three years of sporadic (at best) and forced (at worst) reading to finally get through it. By no means is Politics an easy read; however, much that Aristotle has to offer within is not only fascinating but incredibly useful to anyone who has a mind to the state.",really liked it
19,Annie Jarman,"Pertinent and clearly expressed thoughts concerning the interactions between humans, the importance of involvement, and the relation between government and citizens.

20,Ernest Sneed,"Librivox audiobook: One of the first books of political science that evaluates the various forms of government. The critiques and insights are applicable to the 21st century. The book also ventures into the topics of family planning, education, and even abortion. There are cultural elements of elitism and discrimination against women, foreigners, and slaves.",really liked it
21,Shane,"Most of the assertions in this book either seemed to be obvious common sense or completely absurd. It is how to build a just equitable society with slavery and sexism. Wow. It would be interesting to study Aristotle's critics of Plato and how that debate influenced enlightenment thinkers but in itself this book offers little for modern readers.

22,Katherine,"Read for my philosophy class- less engaging and harder to get meaning from than most of Plato’s work, but still very interesting, with a very interesting typology of regimes. Also contains Aristotle’s defense of natural slavery, which is very famous and worth a read. Politics is the pursuit of the good life. ",really liked it
23,Fred,"(Not finished reading yet.) I have been slow to get started on reading Aristotle because Mortimer Adler, Heidegger and others say he is difficult to read. Book one of Politics was not difficult to read at all. Aristotle's style of argument has some Socratic flavor to it, makes sense since he was Plato's student.

There was a lot of this that read like an ancient Greek citizen randomly expositing in a free-flowing version of a reddit essay of the day, but I guess that's what philosophy is, more or less.

Overall I can say it was good as a classic text, and still holds several beneficial kernels of philosophical theory.",liked it
29,Tayylor,"Another one that doesn't do a great deal for me. I used to prefer Aristotle's form of explanation, but with certain subjects, it is more of a hindrance than anything. Politics is not my favourite subject, true, but I've read philosophers who can make it very interesting for the reader. Aristotle unfortunately fails to do this for me here.
