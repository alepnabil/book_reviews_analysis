0,Brian,"Really interesting. Especially the parts near the end talking about tyrants and their methods. So much that seemed eerily applicable to modern politics. I guess we haven't changed that much in 2000+ years.

1,Hussain,"Much more nuanced than Plato's Republic. Aristotle's understanding of human psychology is incredibly astute, and much of it owes to the countless historical examples he presents to the reader. Should be required reading IMO.

2,Jacob,"Aristotle tends to make me want to fall asleep. This is unfortunate, because the work he does is integral to so many fields of contemporary thought. In particular, I think that his writing on factions and political upheaval/change is important to my thinking on the possibility of political change. ",it was ok
3,Santiago Soria,"Much of the political concepts today can be traced back to this book. Concepts such as the distribution of power in the government, types of government, the relation between those in power and those who obey, and the way property should be distributed. ",liked it
4,Evan,"Aristotle is a genius. He approaches questions that still face us today with careful deliberation and without pretention.Whether you're looking to improve household management or refine political ideology, this book is a mandatory read.

5,Rifat Islam,"he's antidemocratic which forces someone living in a republic to see the merits of republicanism, not that he endorses that form of govt. he advocates for a mix of oligarchy and democracy where virtue is still espoused by leaders

6,Mac,"The thing that I found so fascinating about this book was the way that the plethora of Greek city states provide Aristotle with a bunch of real life experiments with various political organizations. It's a classic for a reason, well worth your time even if it is a little difficult.

7,Eric Walter,Seamlessly flows out of conclusions set forth in Ethics. There is much to wrestle with here simply because you are interacting with a master of logic and a comprehensive worldview. This work logically leads to Rhetoric.,it was amazing
8,Jodi Tooke,"Rigorous examination f politics and what makes politicians. So much has changed yet nothing has changed. Instructive, illuminating and foundational to understanding how and why we govern and allow ourselves to be governed.",it was amazing
9,That one who reads,"this book is interesting but one of the downfalls it's so so dry to read. it has some really interesting points that kept me reading but overall I was not enjoying this book that much. still trying to find books on philosophy that are interesting to read but this is a miss

10,Haythem Jbeli,"One of the greatest books ever written in politics... Nothing to add, but sometimes I don't understand the urge Aristotle shows in criticizing his teacher Plato, while presenting the same or let's say similar solututions to the points he criticized in Plato's works

11,Scott Corsi,An interesting take on early political philosophy in which the author argues for constitutional government. Paints a somewhat Hobbesian view of govenrment. Fascinating read to compare to more modern governments!,it was amazing
12,Zine Smith,"TimelessI luckily read Plato's The Republic before reading this and I recommend that too. This book in many ways is Aristotle's response to Socrates. Some of this is very currently applicable.

13,Mariah,"It bugs me when something as monumental as Aristotle's Politics has less than four stars. How do you hate this? Argue with it, fight with it, wrestle with it, come to the conclusion that he's all wrong, sure. Nobody's all right and Aristotle is often wrong. But never discount it.

14,Christopher,"This book by Aristotle addresses many of the points Plato raises in his Republic. Even though this book forms part of the must-read series of political texts, it is extremely difficult to read. Needs to be read in small doses, will definitely return to it in the future. ",really liked it
15,Daniel Stepke,"very technical, but shines in certain points, like the discussion of citizens, the intersections with ethics, and the best regime and best states for the parts of the city. i extremely disliked the sexism and dimunition of some people as without reason.",really liked it
16,Mariah,"Aristotle is quite easily the most influential ""author"" I've ever read from. By far my most favorite philosopher.

23,Sophie,"Uh... yeah. Well. Someone is not very happy about The Republic, and that someone should maybe take a chill pill. Iâ€™ll stick to Nichomachean Ethics. ",it was ok
24,Hollis Jack,Great political science book. The only one that I could actually comprehend during my SHORT tenure as a politician science student. ,liked it
