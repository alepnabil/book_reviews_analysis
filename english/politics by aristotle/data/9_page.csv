11,Michael Rabara,"A much more realistic view of politics and government. Aside from the long-winded verbiage, it all boils down to a diagram of six-points from best-to-worst starting from a monarchy, aristocracy and a republic; the perversion of each as absolutes. Today, as with all world governments, ours is a collection of most, good and bad. The virtue of justice to the corruption of power.Aristotle, a naturalized Athenian and Alexander the Great's teacher, shames Plato and Socrates idealized form of Utopian Greece, and how human nature always leads to self-centered goals.

12,Mina,"Succinct and to the point, with many examples and comparisons from that day: Athens, Spartans (also referred to as Lacedemonians), Carthage, interesting for both their descriptive quality and for Aristotle's analysis. The creative element of his philosophy is lacking, inasmuch as the his take ruler/ruled duality is fairly just-go-with-it, but compared to other similar works, the direct style and the conclusions are incisive and refreshing.For voluteering to read the free Librivox audiobook edition, many thanks to ontheroad, Doug Wetzel, 	Lucy Burgoyne, Laura Caldwell, Jennifer, Sibella Denton, 	Anna Simon, Leon Mire and 	Robert Scott.

13,Edmond,"There is Plato and then there is Aristotle in philosophy. Aristotle clarifies questions I have had about the “good life.” Virtue is happiness. Aristotle is a good life coach, he gives the best advice on how to live the good life. Virtue is happiness, vice is misery, stay true to your nature.",it was amazing

15,hailey song$,"Was happy to learn more from Aristotle, but some points he made in refute of Plato’s idealistic view was frankly a bit weak. I found myself questioning him often, as some points I agreed and others becoming a red flag. He advocates for a seemingly “realistic city” in which the idea of the rich staying in power and keeping the master-slave relation alive is the ideal solution— uhm...and was there truly ever a sense of democracy in his words??",liked it
16,M. Ashraf,"This was a very dense piece on politics and it's fascinating that this book was written this long ago.I've read ""The Republic"" by Plato and in comparison between the two this was more reasonable than the first and then The republic wasn't that much on comparing government rather than building the perfect model he talked briefly about the forms of government around him , but this was more intense in classifying them talking about each form separately and then comparing them , finally trying to figure the best form it was great.The only point that I favorite ""The Republic"" over ""Politics"" is the view of Socrates to the women , the slaves , the marriage and the labor class.Beside that the ""Politics"" is my favorite in every other aspect , more reasonable but not a visionary , he stated facts , some historical incident around him , he didn't give much his direct view on the best form of government.As ""The Republic"" came first , there was lots of remarking on ""The Republic"" and it wasn't the usual critic rather than an attack on each point he thought it was a flaw in it.Between the Two Plato or Aristotle both were geniuses and I'm going to read ""The Law"" and ""The Ethics"" and continue Socrates dialogues :)Some of points I liked :-Man is by nature a political animal.A constitution is the organization of offices in a state, and determines what is to be the governing body, and what is the end of each community. But laws are not to be confounded with the principles of the constitution; they are the rules according to which the magistrates should administer the state, and proceed against offenders.The demagogues make the decrees of the people override the laws, by referring all things to the popular assembly. And therefore they grow great, because the people have an things in their hands, and they hold in their hands the votes of the people, who are too ready to listen to them. Further, those who have any complaint to bring against the magistrates say, 'Let the people be judges'; the people are too happy to accept the invitation; and so the authority of every office is undermined. Such a democracy is fairly open to the objection that it is not a constitution at all; for where the laws have no authority, there is no constitution. The law ought to be supreme over all, and the magistracies should judge of particulars, and only this should be considered a constitution.The happy life is the life according to virtue lived without impediment, and that virtue is a mean, then the life which is in a mean, and in a mean attainable by every one, must be the best.The best political community is formed by citizens of the middle class, and that those states are likely to be well-administered in which the middle class is large, and stronger if possible than both the other classes, or at any rate than either singly; for the addition of the middle class turns the scale, and prevents either of the extremes from being dominant.Those who think that all virtue is to be found in their own party principles push matters to extremes; they do not consider that disproportion destroys a state.Every man should be responsible to others, nor should any one be allowed to do just as he pleases; for where absolute freedom is allowed, there is nothing to restrain the evil which is inherent in every man. But the principle of responsibility secures that which is the greatest good in states; the right persons rule and are prevented from doing wrong, and the people have their due. It is evident that this is the best kind of democracy.

22,E.C.,"The shocking revelation of Aristotle's Politics is that it stands as a near perfect mirror of modern society's political discourse. Aristotle first addresses the definitions of various forms of governments (tyrannies, oligarchies, democracies, etc.), then lays out the possible intentions and purposes of government, and describes their suitability to specific city-states in existence in the 300s BC. In this way, he balances theory with reality, and acknowledges the imperfections of all forms of government in relation to their creators and enforcers, be they leaders, royalty or the masses. A great deal of Politics refers to civic duty, and the final chapters delve into citizenry and education. It's altogether surprising that the final few pages are devoted entirely to music, what kind of music a citizen should learn and listen to, what instruments should be studied, how bold the music should be, etc. (Note that Politics is likely an incomplete work, so perhaps Aristotle intended to round out his discourse with a more appropriate ending than ""The Power of Music,"" although I found it refreshing and ripe with opportunity to infer deeper meaning.) It would be deceptively easy to dismiss Politics as obsolete based purely on his treatment of women and slaves (both are essentially property; they serve a purpose, but that purpose is hardly representative of modern, individualist values.) In reading past the bigotry, there is an amazing, constant revelation in this treatise: civilization continues to ask the same questions, turn up the same answers, make the same mistakes, and grow incredibly slowly, if at all. In the arena of politics, we (global ""we"") are fundamentally no different today than we were thousands of years ago. The question that Aristotle's Politics then answers is not ""what is the best form of government"" but ""what government should each citizenry live with?"" Given America's constant assertion that democracy is best, this book stokes the debate by suggesting that democracy may be best for us, based on our self-defined values, but is it necessarily best for everyone? Further, using Aristotle's unemotional, unbiased definitions, it's clear that America isn't actually a democracy at all. We are therefore advocating a system of government for other countries that we ourselves cannot uphold. Anyone with a desire to understand America's current turmoil without emotional rhetoric muddying the water will enjoy this book. It's written with elegant simplicity and is accessible to the widest spectrum of readers.

23,Laura,"I studied this in a class in college. I found some of the ideas presented in it deeply troubling, especially when I considered the name of Aristotle which has been thrown about as a kind of father of modern thought and the touchstone of the modern embodiment of democracy. I found it strange to consider the idea of women and slave-men as lesser beings than the intellectual man idealised in this text. The way it was presented to us was just as points to consider, to hold in the context of a debate and I found myself asking the question, as a woman, is there a case for this? (Point to note: the lecturer was also a woman). It kind of made me think that its no wonder that some people hold the views they do in our society. It also made me think of the way some people are looked down upon as lesser because they do not have x,y,z type of education and how manual labour can be handed off to those least able to refuse it, not necessarily those who are least intelligent. It kind of suggested to me a power imbalance and the danger of taking your own perspective too seriously and identifying too strongly with your own gender or those of a similar background to you. I suppose it was an enlightening book to read in a way because it made me ask; what are the ways that I do this and not even realise it? I suppose the difficult part was seeing the logic of some of his arguments but being unhappy with the conclusion he came to. I almost felt complicit in this worldview because I was listening as part of a class and rather than outright rejection of these notions, we were looking to see the message behind them or what they could infer in our modern age. I only took this class as a single module so I don't have in depth knowledge of political texts to compare this to but I could all too readily see the biases inherent in this form of reasoning in the business world, which is where my specialisation was. I guess it did make me re-evaluate my perspective but more in terms of turning away from what he was proposing rather than towards it. I felt that if a collective is not mindful of all the individuals that make it up, then it is a dictatorship by default with scope for limited freedom within those lines. So, overall, it was not what I had anticipated.

24,Brian Schiebout,"Politics by Aristotle and translated into English by Benjamin Jowett is an ancient book about political science. Aristotle truly believed that politics was a science which could be understood in the same way as anatomy or physics. Because of that he wrote this book to help people create a better more stable state. He starts by explaining the way in which a household is like a miniature state and explaining the rules which must be put into place regarding women, children and slaves all of which he seen as less than fully functional beings. After dealing with this he begins his description of the different types of states which he divides into six main primary forms. The first three which he would describe as proper states are monarchy, aristocracy and constitutional government. After that he describes the three corrupted forms as tyranny, oligarchy , and democracy. Monarchy is when one person who is the best in the state rules under the law for the sake of his citizens. This government though is often corrupted into tyranny where one person through strength holds his equals or betters below himself for his own benefit. Aristocracy is when the people who are above average join together to wisely run the state so that it might prosper. Often though it degrades into oligarchy where the power is all in the hands of a few who use the power to try maintain their position. Constitutional government is when people willingly submit to wise laws which are put together to help the state. Democracy is its corrupted form where the poor and the lesser people hold all the power and the better people are ostracized. After explaining these different states he goes on to show how each form of government can be transformed through revolution into another and how a wise leadership group will encourage stability in their state so their government is not overthrown. The final section of the book details his description of a perfect state and how the children should be educated. Overall a good book which is formative in its field of study.

25,Graham Cammock,"Aristotle's Politics is a masterpiece, he starts off talking about how a city (polis) is a compound, with the parts or elements consisting of the household, the village and then the city. A city is a political association or 'sharing', with the end goal of the city being the good life or having the leisure time to engage in politics. Not all people can attain the good life, in order for some people to attain it, some people have to do the menial or degrading tasks, such as slaves, mechanics and manual labourers. He describes how household management consists of the master-slave, husband-wife, or father-children relationships, which correspond to how rulers of the city relate to their subjects. Aristotle discusses constitutions at length, which is how the various political offices of a city are organised. Constitutions are grouped in to two corresponding groups of right and perverted: kingship, aristocracy and 'constitutional government' against tyranny, oligarchy and democracy. Although oligarchy and democracy are classified as perverted constitutions, these are the constitutions Aristotle spends most of the book talking about. He then discusses how the various constitutions are destroyed through factional fighting and how they are best preserved. Aristotle explores every possibility or combination in order I suspect to avoid criticism; he leaves no stone unturned. He then goes on to describe how children should be educated by the city and not privately, in reading and writing, drawing, gymnastics and music. The last chapter is devoted to music education. The work is deep and technical, it's amazing how advanced the Greek philosophers were in the 4th century BC, as compared to the not so much earlier biblical writers of Israel. The analysis of the politics of the city (polis) is a universal example or analogy of the workings of any modern state. One really gains confidence in statecraft and politics, even when applied to large modern states. The translators notes are also imperative. I highly recommend this book to anyone!

26,Oscar Despard,"Aristotle’s ‘Politics’ is a fascinating read. For the most part, this book discusses different ways in which states may be constructed. Arguments for and against each form of constitution are presented, and the defects of the reasoning used to justify each are displayed to the reader. Aristotle's ideas, coming as they do from a different era, are different and thought-provoking. Calling democracy a ‘deviated’ constitution is unthinkable today, but it is a possibility that is worth exploring. Just one instance of the intriguing ideas raised in this book is Aristotle’s view that democracy may (in the situation where the people, under the control of a demagogue, are allowed to rule by decree against the rich) be tantamount to tyranny (the demagogue being able to control popular opinion). This seems hugely relevant to the populist wave sweeping over the political world at the moment.‘The Politics’ was not written as a single volume; it was compiled from several sets of Aristotle’s notes, and is therefore somewhat disjointed in places. However, thanks to the way it has been presented, it is a remarkably easy read. Brief introductions to each chapter sum up the main points before the reader even begins, which allows for a pleasant experience even if (like me) you have no prior knowledge of Greek history or political theory. This book is not perfect; Book I in particular is devoted largely to muddled justifications of slavery and misogyny. However, on the whole, this book gives an insight into so many different aspects of the political issues we discuss today, from underlining the importance of private property ownership to the dangers inherent in democracy that it is impossible not to recommend it. It is absorbing, thought-provoking and interesting, and is well worth a read.

27,Bob Nichols,"Aristotle's Politics is a continuation of his central theme in the Ethics. Man's distinctive feature is his rationality and rational guidance - generally the mean in behavioral expression - is virtuous behavior resulting in the Supreme Good, happiness. The state's role is to support the development and maintenance of this virtuous individual, which includes the rule over those who are not capable of ruling themselves (slaves). Aristotle places great stock in rationality and has created an ideal man that seems to have dominated much of Western philosophy. It's not that rational control of the passions are not important. Rather, it's that the ability of rationality to control (moderate according to the mean) emotions (passions, need) that is in question. Then the task is to move beyond the development of rational man, and toward designing a government and moral system to deal with this darker reality, which, if human history is our guide (Durant), must be entertained. Aristole notes in passing that a most common source of injustice is insult. Insult, along with anger, revenge, fear, contempt and hatred are ancient, pre-rational forms of behavior that lie just beneath, if not pervade, civility, that drive behavior and are so often beyond the reach of rational control. Minimizing these influences among the ruling elements in society is the book's' weakspot. Aristotle's regard for natural slavery is a bit much as is his claim about the superiority of Hellenic civilization as compared to Europe and China that depart from the Hellenic mean. This should caution those who look to Aristole as a source of universal truth. Having said all of this, his vast collection and organization of all things related to the government of his times is very impressive.

28,Manda,"Nomadic SA Chick Book ReviewSummaryWhat motivates man? In this collection of Aristotle works, he examines the heart of political science. He examines different forms of government to determine what might be the best for a society, and how that society can create happiness and harmony for its citizens. Though published a very, VERY long time ago, this is still and standard in any political science program.ReviewThere is not a whole lot to say about this book. It's a collection of Aristotle's writings on political science. Some of it is well known, and some of it hasn't seen the light of day in a very long time. Most of these pieces I had read previously during my masters program a couple of years ago. It's good quality stuff that still holds true today (mostly). I think it is important that we always have these to look back on, and to learn from. A lot of it is a bit dry, but that's mainly due to the writing style of the time these were written. Some are a little boring, but there are just as many, if not more that are exciting and engaging, though that could just be my inner poli sci nerd rearing her little head. I recommend this if you want to learn something more about politics and the pseudo-history of it, or you're just curious about some of Aristotle's works. This won't be a gripping page turner, but it is very informational.Rankings (based on a 10 point scale)Quality of Writing - 8Pace - 5Plot Development - 5Characters - 5Enjoyability - 6Insightfulness - 7Ease of Reading - 6Photos/Illustrations - N/AOverall Score - 3 out of 5 stars

29,Mohammad Ali Abedi,"""A master is only the master of the slave, but no part of him; but the slave is not only the slave of the master, but nothing else but that.""The problem with today’s western world can be directly linked to their ancient philosophy. Sure, they might be proud of it, but in it, there is no real beauty, no love of life, no spirituality, not in terms of religion, but in terms of something more important.Aristotle’s thesis on politics is not only cold and emotionless (and frankly, boring), it’s also unchanged for the mentality of today’s western method of politics. I’m not saying that Aristotle has influenced politics greatly, because to be honest, I don’t see Aristotle as a unique voice in his time, but basically just a voice of not only his time, but his people. Aristotle seems to basically be talking about how politics were fun at that time and his support of it, and by extension, not much has changed since then.""He who proposes to make that inquiry which is necessary concerning what government is best, ought first to determine what manner of living is most eligible; for while this remains uncertain it will also be equally uncertain what government is best: for, provided no unexpected accidents interfere, it is highly probable, that those who enjoy the best government will live the most happily according to their circumstances; he ought, therefore, first to know what manner of life is most desirable for all; and afterwards whether this life is the same to the man and the citizen, or different.""
