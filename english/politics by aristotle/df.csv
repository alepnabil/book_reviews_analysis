0,0,Fergus,"All people desire the Good. So says Aristotle.Yes, EVERYTHING works for the Good. What Good, though? Well, he says, their OWN version of Good! And THAT’s why all politicians are so inherently different - AND why some get on our nerves. And WE’VE all got different preconceptions - ourselves!You see, he learned from his teacher, Plato, that the Good is naturally in our human subconscious - and is also an Ideal - ABOVE us!Want a friendly tip?When you’re finished browsing through the latest headlines screaming blue murder over political dirty double dealings, browse through THIS!It’ll open the windows of your mind and let in some fresh air...Meet the vigorous, affable philosopher Aristotle, as he jostles through the Polis Agora, bumping into old friends, cheerfully waving to others in the distance, and stopping to join his buddies in friendly talk about the government’s latest projects.Some of his interlocutors may gripe that it’s just more of the same old tired routine.Not Aristotle!His well-thought out rebuttal to these naysayers would have been a detailed and densely populated paysage moralisé of plain, optimistic good sense.For Aristotle, bless his soul, always ac-cen-tu-at-ed the Positive!His jauntiness and well-mannered public ease Radiated Good Health.And bonhomie too... He was a good man.He knew what goodness was: because he avoided evil.And he also had a nifty way to get us out of any bad moods - with his twin teaching of ens and potens. For if a person isn’t acting all too nicely now, he always has the potentiality to be Good inside himself!And everything changes.Does that remind you a bit of The Power of Positive Thinking?Maybe, but WHERE did this great thinker get his eternal Optimism and Presence of Mind? You know, there are TWO answers to that question: one simple, the other complex.The simple answer is that Aristotle, through constantly meditating on the Good, gradually let it saturate his Entire Awareness.The difficult answer is the old Zen Koan, to wit, “WHO is this little man who goes in and comes out of your mouth several times a day?” Well the answer, of course is... your Self - in its private, and its public personas.When we open our mouths, we escape into an empty public space. We’re suddenly in the Political Centre Stage. We risk pride, anger, embarrassment - and possible Collapse of this little travelling man, our Self.Aristotle, you see, by fully imbuing himself with the Goodness of Pure Being, had made himself from two separate selves, into One Whole - and the Original - Self!Well, that was Aristotle for you - 2,500 years BEFORE Norman Vincent Peale was even born!And maybe you can’t make a big social splash that way. But your enemies will be few and far between if you practice it!And so we can easily imagine Aristotle put a LOT of otherwise wary people at their ease. But that’s not the picture we’ve been given of him...No - for we’re accustomed to think of him as totally above and beyond us - a gloomy, tendentious old soul who must always remain the privileged property of persnickety professors.But he’s not. He will always be a fresh summer breeze refreshing our callous cynicism!And he will sweep all our dreary snap political judgments right off the table.And begin right back at the beginning with a Level Playing Field.So, there ARE indeed wise, positive-minded thinkers who point us to the straight and narrow road to truth.Like Aristotle, who believed that Good Politicians really DO exist.

1,1,Ahmad Sharabiani,"Πολιτικά = Politics, AristotleAristotle's Politics is divided into eight books which are each further divided into chapters. Citations of this work, as with the rest of the works of Aristotle.In the first book, Aristotle discusses the city (polis) or as he likes to call it a ""political association"". He states that this city and other cities like it are designed and created with the purpose of achieving happiness or something good. Book II examines various views concerning the two different kinds of virtues. These two virtues would be both the intellectual and moral virtues. The difference between these two kinds of virtues would be that a moral virtue is one that is learned by habit and the repetition of it while an intellectual virtue is one that has been taught or instructed to you. For us to be virtuous we must train ourselves and act accordingly as we all are born with the potential to be morally virtuous....تاریخ نخستین خوانش سال 1972 میلادی عنوان: ارس‍طو و س‍ی‍اس‍ت‌؛ نویسنده: ارسطو؛ مترجم: ح‍م‍ی‍د ع‍ن‍ای‍ت‌؛ تهران، نیل؛ 1337؛ در 318ص؛ ت‍ه‍ران‌ امیر کبیر، کتابهای جیبی‏‫، چاپ دوم 1349؛ در 381ص؛ چاپ سوم 1358؛ در 320ص؛ چاپ چهارم 1364؛ چاپ هفتم 1393؛ شابک 9789643031107؛موضوع: مدینه ی فاضله از نویسندگان یونانی سده 4پیش از میلادسیاست عنوان کتابی از ارسطو است. این کتاب را می‌توان در شش بخش شامل هشت کتاب در نظر گرفت؛ بخش اول شامل کتاب اول درباره خانواده؛ بخش دوم شامل کتاب دوم درباره نظرات افلاطون و نقد حکومت‌های اسپارت و کرت و کارتاژ؛ بخش سوم شامل کتاب سوم درباره قانون اساسی؛ بخش چهارم شامل کتاب‌های چهارم و پنجم درباره دموکراسی جمهوری و علل انقلاب‌ها در حکومت‌ها؛ بخش پنجم شامل کتاب ششم درباره روش تشکیل دموکراسی‌ها و پایداری آنها؛ بخش ششم شامل کتاب‌های هفتم و هشتم درباره حکومت کمال مطلوب است؛در پیش گفتار کتاب سیاست اشاره به ناپیوستگی مطالب آن شده‌ است. جناب «حمید عنایت» این کتاب را همانند کتاب مثنوی معنوی مولانا دانسته چون ارسطو کتاب سیاست را از گفتارهای گوناگونی فراهم کرده و به نظر مترجم قصد او گردآوردن آنها در یک مجموعه نبوده‌ است؛ جناب «حمید عنایت» در پیش گفتار کتاب سیاست؛ اهمیت آن را در دو مورد می‌دانند: یکی آنکه روح فلسفه پیشرو زمان ارسطو را منعکس می‌کند؛ و دیگر آنکه سرچشمه ی اصلی اندیشه‌ هایی است که تا پایان سده های میانی بر فلسفه ی سیاسی غرب اثر گذاشته استارسطو اساس خانواده را طبق تقسیم بندی روابط مردم با هم قرار داده و قدرت را عامل اصلی این تقسیم بندی می‌داند؛ او خواسته را بخشی از خانواده می‌داند؛ و هنر به دست آوردن خواسته دیگری در خانواده را تدبیر منزل می‌داند؛ ارسطو فرقی بین روابط قدرت در حکومت و خانواده نمی‌بیند؛ او هر دو را بر اساس روابط قدرت یکسان بررسی کرده‌ است؛ او کسی را که در یک شهر از احترام و مناصب حکومت بی بهره باشد، همچون بیگانه‌ ای می‌داند که در آن سکونت اختیار کرده‌ است؛ ارسطو داوری چند دادرس را که بر حکومت قانون متفق اند بهتر از داوری یک دادرس می‌داند؛ او بقای دموکراسی را به کثرت شهروندان وابسته می‌داند؛ او سعادت را در درست زیستن می‌داند؛ او کار را در زندگی فقط محدود به ارتباط با دیگران نمی‌داند؛ او تفکراتی را که برای نفس تفکر و به هدف درست زیستن صورت می‌گیرند نوعی کار به شمار می‌آورد؛ ارسطو کسانی را در زمره جمعیت کشور می‌داند که جزء گسست ناپذیر آن باشند؛ و عظمت کشور را به فزونی شمار اینگونه مردمان وابسته می‌داند؛ ارسطو زیبایی را از بزرگی و شماره می‌داند؛ و از نظر او آن کشوری را می‌توان کاملتر از کشورهای دیگر شمرد؛ که عظمت را با شماره محدود، و متعادل جمعیت توام داشته باشد، و نیز اندازه ی یک کشور همانند اندازه چیزهای دیگر حدی دارد؛ هرچه بیش از اندازه بزرگ یا کوچک باشد، اثر خود را از دست می‌دهد، و در برخی موارد ماهیتش یکسره دگرگون می‌شود؛ او اداره ی جنگ را بر جمعیت زیاد مردم دشوار می‌داند؛ از نظر ارسطو قانونگذار باید در پی پروراندن افراد شریف باشد و راه رسیدن به این هدف را بجوید؛ تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 06/05/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی

2,2,Tim,"I personally find it tough to do any sort of a review on the classics, as just about everything that can be said about a 2400 year old treatise has probably been said. However, like scripture, everyone has their own interpretation of these kinds of documents from antiquity. The interpretations, like any reading, have to do with the culture and time in which one was raised, the society and government around them, as well as one’s age and any previous influential readings and/or life experience. These previous influences allow a “horizontal” approach to interpretation, where one incorporates many different impressions into the present document.“The Politics of Aristotle” is a link in the evolutionary process of social and political development. Like Plato’s “Republic”, Aristotle considers the concept of justice in this treatise. First, we must define justice, and then we must figure out the best way to enact justice. It is important to remember when dealing with the classics that we are looking at an attempt to tie down a “universal” (itself a tricky word) into a specific place and time. Everyone generally agrees that “justice” is what is “right”. However, conditioning of various types will influence HOW justice looks when pen is put to paper.The area in which I believe Aristotle to have the greatest wisdom is in his descriptions of human nature (and how to approach justice WITH this human nature in mind). “Men who don’t have control of their own passions will fail to serve their own interests.” “We always prefer what we come across first.” “Men are always wanting something more and are never content until they get to infinity.” “Ambition and avarice are exactly the motives which lead men to commit nearly all intentional crimes.”Through my recent dialogue with those residing in the East, it is apparent to me that much of Western philosophy is late in its realization of some universal truths. The conflict of opposites is a universal concept. Moderation as a necessity for “goodness” is a universal concept. This would coincide with the idea of “Non-dualism” that has been around for thousands of years in the Far East. Aristotle attempts to broach these topics through more of an exterior view. For example, he uses the analogy of the “perfection of the nose”. A nose that is “extremely” straight, or “extremely” symmetrical in all areas would eventually become so “extreme” as to not even appear to be a nose. It would morph into something else, if you will. That is an example of dualistic thinking. Extremes in anything produce the opposite of what one is trying to achieve. Moderation, looking at all sides of an issue, eradicating dogmatic thinking, are all ways to avoid these extremes.Modern Capitalistic thought has grasped onto Aristotle’s ideas of distributive justice, aristocracy, and his negation or downplaying of apparent class conflicts to justify certain actions. What Aristotle has not and could not consider is all the complexities of modern times. Race, a global economy, and our current belief in the equality of ALL men do not mix with Aristotelian thought. Plato had a much better grasp on class conflict with the idea of the state being TWO states…that of the rich and that of the poor. Although Aristotle DID acknowledge that: “Poverty is the cause of the defects of democracy.” He adds: “That is why measures should be taken to ensure a permanent level of prosperity.”The eloquence of describing the life of the interior is perhaps the part of “The Politics” which struck me the greatest. ""Thought is an activity as much as action itself, and it may even be more of an activity than action is. The self-contained individual...may be busily active: the activity of God and the universe is that of a self-contained life."" This statement coincided well with one that Aristotle had mentioned in “Rhetoric”, where he states that: “The more I am by myself and alone, the fonder I have become of myths.” This seems to indicate that Aristotle may have had an idea, even if he couldn’t name it, of the inherent need for a “god-image” in the nature of man.Philosophy as defined by the ancient Greeks IS wisdom. Therefore it is in itself a universal as wisdom is all-encompassing. Man’s attempt to make sense of universals containing many expressions is one of the great challenges of living. For me, it has also brought about the realization that we are all looking for the same thing in the end. Approaching others WITH that knowledge is more conducive to dialogue and to greater understanding…which creates a better life for all of us.

3,3,Erick,"Despite the warnings and protests that I have received from goodreads friends about reading Aristotle's politics into our current political situations and vice versa, I will attempt to do just that in this review - unapologetically. Obviously, I am well aware that Aristotle lived over 2300 years ago; indeed, I would have to be pretty ignorant to be reading him to this degree and not be aware of that fact (I have now completed almost his whole corpus - minus his zoological writings and his Eudemian Ethics). Also, I am fully aware that societal conditions do change, in both subtle and not so subtle ways. I am always amazed though at a particular tendency of some people to consider anything more than a few decades old to be passé and obsolete. I am sure my goodreads friends are not guilty of this degree of naivety. I remember debating someone on the American founding fathers and whether their ideas were still relevant to our current political situations...! Yes, someone was actually taking the position that the founding father's views on the republic they formed were not relevant today. This is obviously an extreme example of how clueless people can be when it comes to ideas and their relationship to progress. My feeling is that if you are arguing that past thinkers held demonstrably different ideas when they spoke about freedom, equality, rights, laws, ethics - etc etc et al – then you are simply playing a game of equivocation and using time as an accomplice in your charade. I know my goodreads friends are not this extreme (at least I hope). Why read philosophy if one considers its ideas to have a shelf life? There are certainly more practical uses of one's time if this were the case. I am cognizant of the warnings my friends provided and those warnings are not without merit, but with the preceding introduction, hopefully, I have provided a defense for the following review. The review itself should also make clear where Aristotle's ideas are still relevant. I am certainly willing to debate the merits of Benjamin Jowett's translation because I am taking it as correct. The burden of proof though is on the person who questions Jowett's translation; it is on them to present the Greek words and the English terms that they consider more correct than his rendering. I won't take seriously textual criticisms that don't offer evidence and source material for substantiation. Saying someone claimed something about Aristotle that can't be substantiated is not an argument as far as I am concerned. If one provides sources and evidence, I will certainly take it seriously.I want to first off address one issue that was brought forth in a comment. Aristotle and Plato did not have any experience of the exact kind of democracy we know of today. Aristotle believed in equality, but it was an equality of similars, i.e. only men of a certain status were accepted as citizens. Sharing in that similar condition qualified them as equals. It wasn't equality based on humanity alone. Slaves, women, and children were not included in citizenship in the Greek city-states; and Aristotle did indeed follow this precedent. That is certainly one way that democracy has changed. Of course, these changes were made relatively recently. Basing equality on being human alone is an element that was added to democratic ideals subsequently (one should probably note that Christian ethics was largely the influence behind this innovation). There were, however, reasons for including status (e.g. owning wealth/property, military service, etc) into questions of citizenship in Aristotle's day. That is something I am going to get into below when I talk about the dangers of democracy that have always existed. That is not to say that I support the ancient Greek perspective on this question. Clearly, it doesn't matter what the political system is when one falls into the category of the disenfranchised listed above; all systems would be tyrannical in that case. Any system that does not take into account inherent human value into questions of equality is a system that is not at all just - except in an equivocal sense. One should note that there is absolutely no question that all political systems in the West (including here in America) are rooted in a Greco-Roman precedent. This is as undeniable as that our ethics and morals (not to mention religious ideals) are rooted in a Judeo-Christian precedent. I am certainly of the opinion that those who first wrote on these topics still have something to teach us; and those ideas are often still applicable. I read the Bible because I believe it's morals and ethics are entirely relevant for us. As we move further away from the preceding, the worse society will be. In like manner, the earliest writers on the political systems that inspired ours are still entirely relevant. People often do not have much of a grasp of what occurred in the Greek city-states. The Greeks experimented with different forms of government. These weren't just topics that they debated in writing, they were lived out! I cannot stress this enough. The political systems that are referred to in Plato and Aristotle (removing the speculative elements they added) were tested. Humanity hasn't changed that much in 2300 years. For an example (as I mentioned in my review to Cicero's On Moral Duties), Socialism/Communism is not a new idea. Aristotle was aware that one potential abuse of democracy was when some demagogue promised the disenfranchised that he would take the money and/or property from the wealthy and give it to them if they supported him (I will provide quotes below). Obviously, even if one didn't have property, it didn't necessarily mean that in an ancient democracy that one had no recourse to gaining political power. Aristotle was very wary of the kind of political abuses that were possible within a democracy. He believed (as did Cicero) that every person should be respected in their property. Not respecting the property rights of people was a sure way to bring about revolution. Is this no longer a problem in our American republic? If you think that, guess again. If a party is harboring socialists that do not respect the above fundamental human right of property, you know the same situation that Aristotle and Cicero wrote about is possible even today. Aristotle mentions in more than one place that democracies often descend into very specific abuses. Often it came in the form of some politician scapegoating the well-to-do. This is exemplified in the following quote:“From democracy tyrants have borrowed the art of making war upon the notables and destroying them secretly or openly, or of exiling them because they are rivals and stand in the way of their power; and also because plots against them are contrived by men of this class, who either want to rule or escape subjection.”This applies also to those who are wealthy as Aristotle also makes clear:“Revolutions in democracies are generally caused by the intemperance of demagogues, who either in their private capacity lay information against rich men until they compel them to combine.. or coming forward in public they stir up the people against them.”Of course, the above has been a notable element of communist and socialist countries in the modern world. This is a risk of democracy. He noted numerous examples where democracy would shift into oligarchy and back again – all eventually descending into tyranny. Aristotle was incredibly critical of a pure democracy. This is where the majority have absolute control over the minority. Aristotle calls this the worst form of tyranny. In a pure democracy, 51% of the people have absolute control over 49% of the people. Interestingly enough, the percentages just provided are pretty close to what we have here between Liberals and Conservatives respectively (not taking into account moderates like myself) in America. Unsurprisingly, many of those connected to the American political party that takes it's name from democracy, often do support pure democratic ideals, where even the Constitution and the Bill of Rights should be open to popular vote. The mitigating control to this pure democracy is what Aristotle calls the constitutional government. He includes the constitutional government under the heading of democracy, but he undoubtedly considered them distinct. The constitutional government is more what we would term today a constitutional republic (technically, democracy and republic are the same in ancient Greek sources, but in modern parlance they are distinct). This is what we have here in the United States. Indeed, Aristotle saw this as the best form of government. This is exemplified by the following quote:“For two principles are characteristic of democracy, the government of the majority and freedom. Men think that what is just is equal; and that equality is the supremacy of the popular will; and that freedom and equality mean the doing what a man likes. In such democracies every one lives as he pleases, or in the words of Euripides, 'according to his fancy.' But this is all wrong; men should not think it slavery to live according to the rule of the constitution; for it is their salvation.”Aristotle saw that a balance needed to be struck between law (i.e. constitution) and freedom (i.e. democracy). Losing this balance can be catastrophic as this following quote make clear:“Oligarchy or democracy, although a departure from the most perfect form, may yet be a good enough government, but if any one attempts to push the principles of either to an extreme, he will begin by spoiling the government and end by having none at all… for when by laws carried to excess one or other element in the state is ruined, the constitution is ruined.”Aristotle knew full well that pure democracies gave way to anarchy and then to oligarchy. He was suspicious of democracies for this reason. In democracies, everyone wants to be equal, but in the words of George Orwell, some want to be more equal than others. Part of the problem for Aristotle and other political thinkers of his day was to develop a system that would minimize, if not eliminate, inequities in a populace, and allow them a role in government, without sacrificing more competent voices for less competent voices. This may appear shocking, but one should keep in mind that in Aristotle's point of view, not everyone was equally competent to share in government, even if he were to grant that everyone is equal as far as the category of species goes. Obviously, the ancient Greek attempt to minimize incompetent say in government is not correct, but one has to at the same time acknowledge that a vast percentage of the population that exists in any society (and in any period of time) are not competent enough to have any political power. Very few people in a given population are knowledgeable enough to have an informed opinion on government. Aristotle, with other Greeks, probably assumed if one had gained a certain position or status, it indicated more competence; men were seen as more competent mentally than women; slaves lacked the status and education to be citizens; children were not yet competent prior to proper education. Education was seen as being fundamental to Aristotle's view of governmental longevity. I provide this quote of Aristotle as an example of his position:“But of all the things which I have mentioned, that which most contributes to the permanence of constitutions is the adaptation of education to the form of government, and yet in our day this principle is universally neglected.”We need to appreciate that Greeks like Aristotle were concerned about the rule of an ignorant populace. We must acknowledge this while also condemning their attempts at controlling this through such an unjust method. Aristotle seems to acknowledge above that even those who were citizens were often ignorant. A tyranny of the majority happens when a populace is too ignorant and too self-seeking to make sound political decisions. The American founding fathers set up a very particular system to curb the tyranny of the majority. Ignorant factions of a country can easily become tribalist and disinterested in the health of society as a whole. This is a precursor to social unrest and civil war, i.e. what Aristotle terms revolution. What happens, for instance, when a disenfranchised group gains citizenship and every societal benefit that comes with citizenship? For some of these, this development will be seen as an adequate if not an optimal outcome. For others, it will simply not be good enough. They may then insist that they need special rights that other citizens don't enjoy for them to feel equal and to make up for any feelings of past societal marginalization. Aristotle says this:“The universal and chief cause of this revolutionary feeling has been mentioned already; viz. The desire of equality, when men think that they are equal to others that have more than themselves; or, again, the desire of inequality and superiority, when conceiving themselves to be superior they think that they have not more but the same or less than their inferiors; pretensions which may or may not be just. Inferiors revolt in order that they may be equal, and equals that they may be superior.”Aristotle attributed the revolutionary feeling to these factors that do not need to be based in reality; they only need to be perceived as true. What is at play here? The same ignorant human tendency Cicero also took note of: the tendency of people to be self-seeking and more concerned with superiority and not equality, even when claiming that they are only seeking equality. Once equality is attained, the wise and good will consider this adequate, but those who are neither wise nor good will not consider this adequate. This is not an archaic and inapplicable human tendency, it is still very much present in democracies. Pure democracy is mob rule. Can a democracy be a healthy breeding ground for political parties that harbor socialists, communists and anarchists? Indeed, it can. Having a constitution is a safeguard against these kinds of corrupting influences. Aristotle was also concerned about the wearing away of a constitution. Removing tenets little by little over time. Aristotle says:“Again, the revolution may be accomplished by small degrees; I mean that a great change may sometimes slip into the constitution through neglect of a small matter...”And again says in relation to Aristocratic constitutional government (I doubt he would consider the effects to be any different than in a democratic constitutional government):“The citizens begin by giving up some part of the constitution, and so with greater ease the government change something else which is a little more important, until they have undermined the whole fabric of the state.” One can certainly find an example of this sort of thing in this country recently. Not too long ago, a president instituted something called the Patriot Act that was a serious breach of the constitution. This allowed data collection and other things that compromised the rights of citizens. Aristotle was aware that in his day, tyrants utilized informants to infiltrate almost every aspect of societal life. These informants were the data collectors of Aristotle's day. Aristotle knew rightly that these are the tactics of tyrants and they are not desirable for a free society. Interestingly enough, he also noted that tyrants often attempted to keep the populace focused on things not pertinent to their role in government; these could take the form of fighting foreign wars and/or infighting between groups within a society. I leave it to the reader to decide if this still happens and if this sort of thing is still relevant in today's democracies. The preceding are the thoughts I had while reading this. Every review is simply a collection of my thoughts on anything I read. I am very far from believing that what Aristotle wrote about is irrelevant today. Indeed, I feel quite the opposite. Like the Nicomachean Ethics, which was the preceding volume to the Politics, Aristotle believed in moderation. He believed in a political balance between freedom and law, democracy and constitutional government. He was suspicious of extremes. I think that was an astute appraisal of politics. We would do well to take the same position in regards to politics today. It may be too much to hope when considering that I am a moderate Libertarian that the reader will see this as an adequate defense of political moderation, but hopefully the fact that this isn't a new idea and was the position of thinkers in the past may give it some merit. I am giving the book a 4 star review. The book caused me to reflect quite a bit. I reject Aristotle's caste system where certain people are denied citizenship and rights. I also find his defense of infanticide incredibly abhorrent, but it is hardly surprising when one considers his position on the value of children.

4,4,J,"This is quite a turn away from the optimistic ""we can figure it all out"" tone of the Nicomachean Ethics. In trying to confront both what a state is and how it functions, he creates this weird/insidious master/slave hierarchy, expanding it to encompass children, women, basically anyone who isn't a member of the Athenian aristocracy. While this in and of itself isn't really shocking considering how the typical greek polis maintained and grew it's own power (i.e. going to war, stealing women, land and gold etc.) his inability to fully justify this kind of hierarchy without resorting to some knee-jerk idea of a natural order is a huge problem. Slavery and gender inequality are ultimately mandated and reinforced because, well, basically because he says so. Which is a real cop-out compared to the tight, forward reasoning in a lot of his other works. At the same time, he's one of the first thinkers to recognize that for how fucked up and oppressive a state can be towards its members, it gets even more so when issues of money and finance take over and dominate to the point where the only questions that are taken seriously are those pertaining to making more dough. It's a deeply flawed book about a deeply flawed, though inescapable topic.

5,5,Aurelia,"Political philosophy is a fundamental part of the legacy of the ancient Greeks. The questions of distribution of power, public justice and order, rights and duties, citizenship, the efficient use of resources and national security, lay at the heart of this tradition. In a civilization of unparallel political constitutional creativity and diversity, legendary lawgivers and great political theorists, Aristotle is pushing the discussion further to reach matters we still debate today.What seems most essential to Aristotle’s political thought, before any talk of the perfect constitution, is the fact that a real state is the one where citizens take turns in holding power. Aristotle dismisses states where power is held by one man and the rest have a slave like status. He associates this situation with non Greeks, who lack spirit and are slavish, especially the Asians. If taking turn in ruling among the citizens is the backbone of any state, the requirements of citizenship are a much complicated matter. The occupation, wealth, virtue and education of citizens are all parameters one should take in consideration in order to address the question of the ideal constitution.Faithful to his analytical and teleological spirit, Aristotle discusses the aims of a constitution in the first place. Of course to be happy is what any human being seeks, this goes for an association of humans too. Now happiness does not depend solely on accidents of Fortune, such as great beauty for individuals or natural resources for states. Happiness does not depend on chance and is not waited for passively. It is the active exercise of virtue and wisdom, practical wisdom in particular. A good constitution is the one adapted to what chance throws at you randomly. It is also not a fixed set of laws, which can be used by all states. Instead, he pulls us back to ancient Greece where every state makes its own constitution, adapt it to its social, geographical and ideological peculiarities. It is also changeable, adaptable with reforms to keep going with new configurations, of course in the limits of a certain degree of stability.Again, with Aristotle’s Ethics in the background, the way for an ideal constitution is the middle one. So he favors what he calls a mixed constitution. He discusses at great length the advantages and limitations of the systems invented by his time : democracies, oligarchies, tyrannies, monarchies… he lists reasons for their stability and instability, their adaptability to different levels of prosperity and the nature of their populations, to come up with remedies for each of their problems. So an oligarchy must be combined with elements of democracy to make it more stable and so on… According to Aristotle, political upheaval is the result of some groups of people demanding equality because they think they are inferior, or others who are not satisfied when being equaled to others because they think they are superior. Equality is not justice, for the simple reason that people are not equal in all aspects. Justice in Democracy is arithmetic, what is just is what the majority believe it is so, while in oligarchy more power is given to property owning individuals to decide what is just.These inequalities seem to be taking for granted by Aristotle, which can be very confusing to a modern reader. If class struggle in the Marxist sense is the least of Aristotle’s problems, he does admit that in democracies the rule of the majority can lead to them harassing the rich and confiscating their properties, while in oligarchies, men in power tend to use it to augment their influence and thus form power groups. Aristotle does not talk about democracy in the way we moderns think of it, as the most perfect system there is to bring some kind of almost divine justice and equality to all. He does not seem to raise it above oligarchies or tyrannies or even monarchies, and puts much emphasis on its deviations. These systems, although deemed by moderns as inherently unjust, are viable if implemented in the right circumstances.

6,6,Jonathan Karmel,"In Politics, Aristotle theorized that in a perfect world, a monarchy would be a benevolent dictatorship, an aristocracy would be rule by the virtuous and democracy would be rule by the people. But because of human frailty, monarchy actually becomes tyranny, aristocracy actually becomes oligarchy and pure democracy actually becomes mob rule. The practical solution is a form of government that mixes elements of a single ruler, rule by the few and majority rule.This idea survived and evolved, and eventually the English developed a system of government with a monarch, a House of Lords and a House of Commons. Later, a system of government was created in the United States with a separation of powers among a President, a Senate and a House of Representatives.How amazing that Aristotle wrote a book so long ago that has had such influence on world history right up to the present day!

7,7,Paul Haspel,"Politics is intrinsic to human life, as Aristotle knew well. One of the most famous quotes from this classic work of political philosophy is “ὁ ἄνθρωπος φύσει πολιτικὸν ζῷον.” This Greek phrase is often translated as “Man is by nature a political animal,” though I prefer to think of it as saying that “Humankind is by nature a political species.” However you translate Aristotle’s words, the fact remains that, 2400 years after Aristotle wrote the Politics in the 4th century B.C., we in the 21st century A.D. are still comparing societies in terms of their political structures, just as Aristotle did. As long as citizens care about the shape their nations take, Aristotle’s Politics will remain relevant.Regular readers of Aristotle’s work will detect echoes of other Aristotelian texts while reading the Politics. For instance, I hear echoes of De Anima, with its declaration that human beings are the only animals with souls, in the way Aristotle in the Politics follows up on his statement about humankind as a political species by declaring that “obviously man is a political animal in a sense in which a bee is not, or any other gregarious animal. Nature…has endowed man alone among the animals with the power of speech” (p. 60) – a classically Aristotelian declaration. Contemporary researchers who study communication among the more intelligent of our fellow animals – apes, dolphins, whales – might take issue with Aristotle’s claim. But then Aristotle, like any good scientist, reasons from the verifiable and replicable evidence available to him, and then sets forth his conclusions – knowing that someday, future scientists will challenge his findings, the way a young Aristotle challenged his old teacher Plato.For Aristotle, it follows that, as humankind is a political species, human beings will inevitably organize themselves into societies that will organize themselves according to some sort of set of rules. For the remainder of the Politics, Aristotle reviews the relations among different groups of human beings, looks at the constitutions of various Greek states of his time, and considers the different options available to those who are trying to set up a state: democracy, aristocracy, oligarchy, tyranny. And the stakes are high: as Aristotle points out, “a state’s purpose is not merely to provide a living, but to make a life that is good” (p. 196). Think about it: if you had two options, and only two, would you rather be a citizen of Sweden, or of North Korea?As he is considering the position of the citizen in a wide variety of states – Athens, Carthage, Crete, Sparta, Syracuse – it is good that Aristotle provides a definition of the citizen: “[O]ne who has a share in ruling and in being ruled….So far as the best constitution is concerned, he is a man who is able and who chooses to rule and to be ruled with a view to a life that is in accordance with virtue” (p. 213). Aside from its restrictiveness in terms of gender – Aristotle’s attitude toward women is always one of the weaknesses of his philosophical system – it is a definition of citizenship that is still applicable today.The first-time reader of the Politics may be surprised to discover that Aristotle, like his mentor Plato, is not at all enthusiastic about democracy. Today, people around the world use the terms “democracy” and “democratic” to describe what is assumed to be the most desirable state for a society: one in which each citizen has equal rights, and no citizen has more rights than others. International organizations like Freedom House issue regular reports that indicate which countries of the world are most or least free, meaning most or least democratic. Aristotle, by contrast, did not think about democracy that way. Readers of Aristotle know that he always follows “the principle of the middle way” (p. 330); and for him, the form of government that is most to be desired is what he calls the ""polity,"" meaning “a mix of oligarchy and democracy” (p. 259). The polity gives the wealthy and well-born a stake in maintaining the features of society that have protected their high social position, and at the same time gives the more numerous members of the general public a sense that they too have a fair chance of ascending into the highest levels of wealth and status.In the Constitution of the United States of America, one sees Aristotle’s influence, particularly in Article I that sets forth the responsibilities of the Congress. The numerically more numerous House of Representatives – 435 strong, as of this writing – has always been voted on by all eligible citizens (though the definition of “citizen” has repeatedly had to be expanded at various points in American history). By contrast, members of the Senate – a numerically smaller body whose members serve longer terms of office and have more power – were originally selected by state legislatures, not by the people generally, and were expected to represent the interests of the wealthy. That Aristotelian desire to create an American polity, a moderate form of government that would avoid the excesses of mob rule and tyranny, also seems to have nourished the creation of the Electoral College – a body through which, twice in the last two decades, a candidate has been elected President of the United States while losing the popular vote: once by half a million votes, the second time by three million. You can decide for yourself how you feel about that.The English-speaking reader of the Politics should not be surprised to find him- or herself comparing constitutions across the Anglosphere the way Aristotle compared constitutions across the Greek-speaking world. I found myself comparing the United States Constitution, in its particular features, with the constitutions of Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India. The U.S. constitution came off the better in some of these comparisons – not so well in others. Sometimes, the Politics must be read in historical context. It is disheartening in the extreme, for example, to see how Aristotle not only takes for granted the existence of slavery in even the freest Greek states, but also assumes that enslaved people accept their lot and have no yearning for freedom. No wonder pro-slavery Southern politicians from the pre-Civil War era raced to quote Aristotle when defending slavery inside the U.S. Capitol and their various statehouses.Other parts of the Politics are more applicable to the modern world; and indeed, there is something in Aristotle’s Politics for everyone. Members of the conservative Trump administration, with its “America First” mantra, might rejoice in Aristotle’s declaration that “a state’s trading must be in its own interest and not in others’” (p. 407). On the other hand, liberal Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would no doubt agree with Aristotle's statement that “there should be laws laid down about education, and…education itself must be made a public concern” (p. 453). Whatever your own politics, you care about your society, and about the future shape that your society will take; and every person who fits that description should read Aristotle’s Politics.

9,9,Cody,"Come on Aristotle! You really wrote a lame book man. I'm gonna have to go read Plato's Republic to shake the funk out. I mean hey, I know you're supposed to be one of the world's greatest thinkers and you were the founder of formal logic and all. But dude, your ethics suck. What the jazz are you talking about in this book about how everyone needs to be ruled, and those who lack the rationality to rule themselves need to be ruled by others? I mean, I guess that ends up happening to people who lack rationality as they blindly follow groups like the Republican/Tea Party and the propaganda of the corporate-controlled media. But NOT COOL.Slavery = bad. ...Sadly, it appears that your words were prophetic as most of us have become wage slaves. And I'm not sure about the city being more important than family which in turn is more important than the individual. Tottle talks about politics being more like an organism instead of a machine and that it's a collection of parts where none can exist without the others. Aristotle said the city (polis) is not just about laws and economic stability, but it's about pursuing the good and noble life. He stated the goal was to perform noble acts: ""The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together."" This is different from Thomas Hobbes, for example, who said there was a social contract where individuals leave the state of nature because of ""fear of violent death."" Aristotle, I think you've inspired me to go read something more fun.

12,12,Genni,"“Man is a political animal.”-The perfect springboard for Aristotle's political tome. The book is largely divided, though not perfectly sectioned off, into sections concerning his political philosophy and analysis. His philosophy was a little difficult to ascertain. His idea of a citizen is severely limited, arguing that men are born to “rule or be ruled”. He says that the same means are needed to make a good man as a good constitution. And his insistence that the whole comes before the parts (the polis before the individual) left me, as a modern reader, pretty skeptical. He seems to think that the individual can only be fulfilled in a political setting. The city is not organized to simply provide protection, but to enable the citizen (again, the few who qualify) to obtain the good life. But then he thinks the “good life”, which is to be attained through participation in government, is one of leisure?? It seems to me that a life of leisure can only be built on the backs of those who are willing (or made, in the case of slavery) to provide such a life, meaning very few people could obtain this. I didn't quite get how all of this is supposed to work. But I have not read  Nicomachean Ethics yet, so my lack of understanding may lie somewhere between the two books.His political analysis of different forms of government, in their ideal and practical forms, was interesting reading (mostly). He had an intense knowledge of the constitutions of his day and their strengths and weaknesses. He discusses how different conflicts within different classes leads to constitutional changes. His comments in this section on changes from aristocracy to democracy truly made me think of the French Revolution, which made think he was mostly on target in these sections, but I am no political analyst. Mostly, I just appreciated the groundwork he laid for the future conversations that lead to our constitution. On his treatment of slavery: I could not help but compare the differences between the Ancient Hebrew laws on slavery and Aristotle's comments. As I hope others will understand the importance of not reading ancient texts like the Bible with modern sentiments, I tried to offer the same understanding to Aristotle. But he really lost me here. He constantly referred to slaves as irrational creatures. There seemed to be something at work here, for he said perhaps some are wrongfully enslaved, but mostly he felt their plight was just and to their benefit. Ancient Hebrew laws also were to the benefit of the “slave”, but in the interest of setting them free from debt, and ultimately, to be free to leave. Ancient Hebrew law looked progressive compared to Aristotle's comments. Aristotle made me laugh with this comment, “No one in his youth resents being ruled.” HA. I thought Aristotle had children, but Wikipedia must be mistaken...To sum up with a word to the wise he says,“Not all democratic or Oligarchic measures are calculated to ensure the permanence of democracy or oligarchy.” The cardinal importance of educating citizens to live and act in the spirit of the constitution cannot be underestimated. “This is too often neglected, especially in extreme democracies which encourage the idea of 'living as one likes'”.

15,15,Justin Tapp,"There are so many consequential ideas in this book that it's amazing it's not required reading in Western classrooms anymore. The Benjamin Jowett translation is easily accessible in many formats. Perhaps just as it was ""lost"" to the Middle Ages until ""rediscovered"" and translated into Latin in the 12th century it is lost to today.Prerequisites for reading this book are Plato's Republic and The Laws, of which I read the former. The Republic is the more important as Aristotle spends much time critiquing Socrates' ideal state and the deficiencies of its description and order. There are parallel themes but the many variations of the basic forms of government are explained more clearly by Aristotle, who is not designing so much the ""ideal state"" as Socrates was. I will read Augustine's City of God later this year, as both works were influential in affecting future thinking about governments by Aquinas and others which, in turn, affected Thomas Jefferson and the Founders. I was surprised how much economics was in this book, circa 350 B.C.. At points, it reads quite a bit like Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. It is hard to believe such a gap in years exists between the two works, actually. I'm also surprised by how little of Aristotle's work is mentioned in traditional books on the history of economic thought. Take, for example, Book II's exploration of the importance of property rights. Part V:""should the citizens of the perfect state have their possessions in common or not?...Property should be in a certain sense common, but, as a general rule, private; for, when everyone has a distinct interest, men will not complain of one another, and they will make more progress, because every one will be attending to his own business. And yet by reason of goodness, and in respect of use, 'Friends,' as the proverb says, 'will have all things common.'.. It is clearly better that property should beprivate, but the use of it common; and the special business of the legislator is to create in men this benevolent disposition.""Aristotle responds to those who would argue for common ownership directed by the State:""there is the greatest pleasure in doing a kindness or service to friends or guests or companions, which can only be rendered when a man has private property. These advantages are lost by excessive unification of the state...Such legislation may have a specious appearance of benevolence; men readily listen to it, and are easily induced to believe that in some wonderful manner everybody will become everybody's friend, especially when some one is heard denouncing the evils now existing in states, suits about contracts, convictions for perjury, flatteries of rich men and the like, which are said to arise out of the possession of private property. These evils, however, are due to a very different cause- the wickedness of human nature. Indeed, we see that there is much more quarrelling among those who have all things in common, though there are not many of them when compared with the vast numbers who have private property.""Aristotle understood that greed and avarice were inherent in human nature. People were more likely to act in mutual benefit when property is held privately-- Adam Smith's butcher seems to pick up on this theme. Another benefit, according to Aristotle, was greater ""temperance toward women"" than when they were held in common as prescribed by Socrates in The Republic.Conservatives everywhere find agreement with Aristotle in arguing from the wisdom of historical precedent when confronted with ideas that challenge the existing order:""Let us remember that we should not disregard the experience of ages; in the multitude of years these things, if they were good, would certainly not have been unknown; for almost everything has been found out, although sometimes they are not put together; in other cases men do not use the knowledge which they have."" In the above I hear echoes of Solomon's ""there is nothing new under the sun,"" and the modern axiom that those who don't remember their history are condemned to repeat it.One major critique of Socrates' The Republic is that Socrates established law for the Guardians but does not say what he would do for the lower classes. Aristotle argues that if same laws apply, the people would not have any desire to submit to the government. If all property were held in common there would be no motivation to work the fields. This recognition of property rights creating incentives is an important cornerstone of microeconomics and is too often forgotten by modern policymakers.Socrates' Guardians were destined to rule for life, but Aristotle states this is dangerous. He also points out that if the government is going to fix the amount of property, it should also fix the number of children, and then you start getting into a critique of central planning that borders on Hayekian. He also asks what should be done with slaves and cites the Cretans as having a ""wise"" policy of allowing them to have the same institutions as freemen but forbidding physical training or armaments among them. There is a wealth of information about the make-up of institutions in various Greek city-states.Book III, Part XI:Socrates examines autocracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, and describes both theoretical and historical variations on all types. In examining arguments for the various forms, I noted that Aristotle often cites the wisdom of crowds that sounds very Hayekian or at least from the 20th century: ""The principle that the multitude ought to be supreme rather than the few best is one that is maintained, and, though not free from difficulty, yet seems to contain an element of truth. For the many, of whom each individual is but an ordinary person, when they meet together may very likely be better than the few good, if regarded not individually but collectively, just as a feast to which many contribute is better than a dinner provided out of a single purse. For each individual among the many has a share of virtue and prudence, and when they meet together, they become in a manner one man, who has many feet, and hands, and senses; that is a figure of their mind and disposition. Hence the many are better judges than a single man of music and poetry; for some understand one part, and some another, and among them they understand the whole.""There are also explanations for how governments evolve from one form to another. I found these similar to Socrates' explanations of the same. For example, Book V Part IV:""Governments also change into oligarchy or into democracy or into a constitutional government because the magistrates, or some other section of the state, increase in power or renown. Thus at Athens the reputation gained by the court of the Areopagus, in the Persian War, seemed to tighten the reins of government. On the other hand, the victory of Salamis, which was gained by the common people who served in the fleet, and won for the Athenians the empire due to command of the sea, strengthened the democracy.""Aristotle writes that laws should not be changed frequently as it takes time for citizens to develop the habits intended under the law. Frequent changes undermine both the basic institute of law and the constitution. This is a good reminder for modern Progressives who chafe against the laborious efforts required to change the law. Why were the powers and rules of the U.S. Senate, for example, so bent toward impeding legal changes? Because the founders knew their Aristotle and, like their European forebears, found wisdom in it. (A reminder that Senators in most states were not even elected by the population until the early 20th century.)Aristotle examines various nation-states' constitutions and weighs their pros and cons. There is a great question in each government of who should rule and how they should be chosen. Popular election is problematic because the majority of the population is poor and likely to take bribes. It's much better to elect people according to some system or measure of ""merit,"" or ""virtue."" For details, see Book IV Part XV. I am reminded much of Acemoğlu and Robinson's exhaustive work in Why Nations Fail (in a nutshell, their thesis is that nations fail to develop because certain people gain economic power and erect exclusive political institutions to defend their holds. Extractive economic institutions + exclusive political arrangements = lack of property rights and incentives for the majority population, and hence poverty and unrest).Aristotle mainly describes and accepts political institutions as the present reality, be it tyranny or democracy. All can have positive elements. But he seems to favor certain forms of democracy as the best, which seems to have been the common Greek belief of his day. But anarchic, populist democracies are the least-preferred of all:Book V Part IV:""For two principles are characteristic of democracy, the government of the majority and freedom. Men think that what is just is equal; and that equality is the supremacy of the popular will; and that freedom means the doing what a man likes. In such democracies every one lives as he pleases, or in the words of Euripides, 'according to his fancy.' But this is all wrong; men should not think it slavery to live according to the rule of the constitution; for it is their salvation.""Likewise, Book VI Part II:""The basis of a democratic state is liberty; which, according to the common opinion of men, can only be enjoyed in such a state; this they affirm to be the great end of every democracy. One principle of liberty is for all to rule and be ruled in turn, and indeed democratic justice is the application of numerical not proportionate equality; whence it follows that the majority must be supreme, and that whatever the majority approve must be the end and the just. Every citizen, it is said, must have equality, and therefore in a democracy the poor have more power than the rich, because there are more of them, and the will of the majority is supreme. This, then, is one note of liberty which all democrats affirm to be the principle of their state. Another is that a man should live as he likes. This, they say, is the privilege of a freeman, since, on the other hand, not to live as a man likes is the mark of a slave. This is the second characteristic of democracy, whence has arisen the claim of men to be ruled by none, if possible, or, if this is impossible, to rule and be ruled in turns; and so it contributes to the freedom based upon equality. ""...""there is no difficulty in forming a democracy where the mass of the people live by agriculture or tending of cattle. Being poor, they have no leisure, and therefore do not often attend the assembly, and not having the necessaries of life they are always at work, and do not covet the property of others. Indeed, they find their employment pleasanter than the cares of government or office where no great gains can be made out of them, for the many are more desirous of gain than of honor.""Aristotle describes four different kinds of democracy, and apparently favors the first:""One type of democracy is when farmers and those possessing a moderate amount of property have authority. They govern themselves in accordance with law because their work leaves them little leisure time. They therefore meet in the assembly only as absolutely necessary [to make decisions on matters not covered by the code of law]. A share [in the system of government] is open to anyone as soon as they meet the financial assessment set by law. They cannot be at leisure [for public service in governing] unless there is public revenue [to subsidize their participation].""He has an apt description of tyrants in Book V Part XI:""Tyrants are always fond of bad men, because they love to be flattered, but no man who has the spirit of a freeman in him will lower himself by flattery; good men love others, or at any rate do not flatter them. Moreover, the bad are useful for bad purposes; 'nail knocks out nail,' as the proverb says. It is characteristic of a tyrant to dislike every one who has dignity or independence; he wants to be alone in his glory, but any one who claims a like dignity or asserts his independence encroaches upon his prerogative, and is hated by him as an enemy to his power. Another mark of a tyrant is that he likes foreigners better than citizens, and lives with them and invites them to his table; for the one are enemies, but the Others enter into no rivalry with him.""Like Hayek in Road to Serfdom, Aristotle argues for a basic social safety net even in a constitutional democracy with limited government:Book VI Part V:""the poor are always receiving and always wanting more and more, for such help is like water poured into a leaky cask. Yet the true friend of the people should see that they be not too poor, for extreme poverty lowers the character of the democracy; measures therefore should be taken which will give them lasting prosperity; and as this is equally the interest of all classes, the proceeds of the public revenues should be accumulated and distributed among its poor, if possible, in such quantities as may enable them to purchase a little farm, or, at any rate, make a beginning in trade or husbandry""rich should also pay the fees for the assemblies and the religious institutions."" Likewise, he argues, the wealthy should also pay for the fees for the assemblies and the religious institutions. The role of the state, overall, is to maximize the happiness-- read: utility-- of the population. This seems very 18th century. Aristotle then examines what constitutes this happiness. One aspect reminds me of the epistles of the apostles James and Paul. Book VII Part 1 deals with the relationship of material goods and virtue (emphasis mine):""Some think that a very moderate amount of virtue is enough, but set no limit to their desires of wealth, property, power, reputation, and the like. To whom we reply by an appeal to facts, which easily prove that mankind do not acquire or preserve virtue by the help of external goods, but external goods by the help of virtue, and that happiness, whether consisting in pleasure or virtue, or both, is more often found with those who are most highly cultivated in their mind and in their character, and have only a moderate share of external goods, than among those who possess external goods to a useless extent but are deficient in higher qualities; and this is not only matter of experience, but, if reflected upon, will easily appear to be in accordance with reason.""... God is a witness to us of this truth, for he is happy and blessed, not by reason of any external good, but in himself and by reason of his own nature. And herein of necessity lies the difference between good fortune and happiness; for external goods come of themselves, and chance is the author of them, but no one is just or temperate by or through chance. In like manner, and by a similar train of argument, the happy state may be shown to be that which is best and which acts rightly; and rightly it cannot act without doing right actions, and neither individual nor state can do right actions without virtue and wisdom. Thus the courage, justice, and wisdom of a state have the same form and nature as the qualities which give the individual who possesses them the name of just, wise, or temperate.""In this I hear Paul's exhortation of contentment in 1 Timothy 6:5-12:""constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. But godliness with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into the world, andc we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs. But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness.""It's worth noting that the Church eventually essentially canonized the work of Aristotle, which had problematic results in the area of science just as much as philosophy (just ask Galileo). But could Paul be agreeing with Aristotle here? Another passage that is reminiscent of Paul comes in Book I, when Aristotle is talking about the natural order, including the relationship between men and women, parents and children, masters and slaves:""Clearly, then, moral virtue belongs to all of them; but the temperance of a man and of a woman, or the courage and justice of a man and of a woman, are not, as Socrates maintained, the same; the courage of a man is shown in commanding, of a woman in obeying. And this holds of all other virtues, as will be more clearly seen if we look at them in detail...All classes must be deemed to have their special attributes; as the poet says of women:'Silence is a woman's glory,'but this is not equally the glory of man. "" Another translation I found renders this: ""silence is a woman's ornament""- and Sophocles identified as the poet. This immediately reminded me of 1 Corinthians 14:33-35: ""As in all the churches of the saints, the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.""likewise, 1 Corinthians 11:13-15""Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him, but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory?""Long hair (or head covering) in conjunction with silent submission seem to be for her ""glory"" and Paul affirms this to be true both in the Hebrew Law and ""nature,"" the latter of which is referred to in Politics Book I. Fascinating. Aristotle concludes with a look at what the state should do in regards to children and education in order to maximize the future happiness of the citizenry. Book VIII Part I:""The citizen should be molded to suit the form of government under which he lives. For each government has a peculiar character which originally formed and which continues to preserve it. The character of democracy creates democracy, and the character of oligarchy creates oligarchy; and always the better the character, the better the government...Neither must we suppose that any one of the citizens belongs to himself, for they all belong to the state, and are each of them a part of the state, and the care of each part is inseparable from the care of the whole. In this particular as in some others the Lacedaemonians are to be praised, for they take the greatest pains about their children, and make education the business of the state. The customary branches of education are in number four; they are- (1) reading and writing, (2) gymnastic exercises, (3) music, to which is sometimes added (4) drawing."" Aristotle calls for public education provided by the state in contrast to the common policy among Greeks to hire private tutors to teach whatever the client wished. Aristotle channels Socrates a bit in discussing an ideal state where people would be forbidden from marrying and procreating too young, or in having children at too old an age in order to prevent ""weak"" children incapable of defending the state. Children should be allowed to develop a sort of ""meanness"" in their early years and parents should properly expose them to the cold in

16,16,8314,"To anyone who is interested in this book: make sure you read Ethics first.This is the first Aristotle I have read and I have more questions than opinions. It might turn out that this review is a total stupidity but -- I've done worse (plus I'm a heartless bitch). So here we go.0) The nicknames ""divine Plato and daemonic Aristotle"".I heard this notion from Leo Strauss in his lecture on Symposium and I kept wondering what this could mean. Still have no idea what it could mean -- that Plato is as divine as those manipulative a-hole Olympians and Aristotle as straightforward and inhibiting as daemon? Unlikely, but I'd buy it.1) ""Truth is dear to me, dearer still is ...""There's a very famous quote of Aristotle: ""Plato is dear to me, dearer still is the Truth.""Comparing to his teacher, Aristotle is much more down-to-earth and scientific. Xenophon is a historian, Plato a poet, Aristotle a scientist. There are many paragraphs that provided invaluable records of various regimes in Antiquity, from which Aristotle derived his lesson. This differentiates Aristotle from Plato: his method is inductive instead of deductive. What differentiates Aristotle from Xenophon is something else -- lack of benevolence.Aristotle mentioned Xenophon in the beginning, where he argued that Oeconomicus really could not serve as a teaching material for politicians because slaves are essentially different from citizens. On second thought, Xenophon actually displayed a more humane, more benevolent attitude here: he resembled slaves as one of the family members. The same difference showed up again when Aristotle talked about tyranny. He displayed a rather cliché attitude, a mixture of contempt and disgust. Xenophon worked differently in Hiero, arguing that if legitimacy is something a tyrant could never desire, perhaps by sharing honors he could get along with his people better. If tyrants could not hope to teach justice, then perhaps he could hope to teach people to dispose their anger in a right way. The mindset is different. Personally I favor Xenophon's.2) The size of body politic.Maybe I will live to regret saying this, but I think there's a reflux of mindset from Plato to Aristotle. Plato acknowledges individuality, in the sense that he crafted his Republic to be a regime designed to produce great individuals. Needless to say, the Republic is evil; the Laws even worse. But I honestly think that one would be owning Plato credit if one ignored the valuable observations made by Plato: that to create heroes, one needs great affliction, torment, and endurance. It's a bloody truth that great philosophers should suffer; they have to suffer.故天将降大任于是人也，必先苦其心志，劳其筋骨，饿其体肤，空乏其身，行拂乱其所为，所以动心忍性，曾益其所不能。——孟子Hence if Heaven wishes to assign great responsibility to an individual, one must first suffer mentally, labor physically, be in hunger, be in poverty, be in misfortune. From this one should be shaken and tempted and consolidated, and his defects improved. -- MenciusIn Aristotle all of this is absent, as far as I could observe. There's no wish to see an individual transcend, to go beyond. Instead Aristotle cared about something else: not the individual, but the city-state as a whole. It's no longer ""city-states serving to create great individuals"", but ""suitable individuals for the sake of city-state"". Leisure is thus placed above all things else. Plato may well be staring at the dawn of individuality, within one person all the politics are internalized, but Aristotle seemed to be stepping back and yielding to the common mindset at that time: the city-state as a whole.But then, since I haven't read Ethics yet, I could not say for sure. 3) Crazy stuff.I wrote this when I finished reading the Courage of Truth. And then I thought this idea is too crazy so I dumped it to the draft box of my blog. Now it seems like it's not that crazy, since Aristotle did display a mindset of treating a group of people as a whole, a creature that could think:If parrhesia is the means to make others realize in order to make a wise choice -- and forget not that there is no individuality in ancient Greece, not quite the idea of personal characters even (cf. Jacque Le Goff, Saint Louis) -- could we say that once upon a time, the behavior of reasoning and decision-making was interpersonal? When was it forced into individuals?When were individuals made responsible for their realizations (of status quo), and consequently the ""extinction"" of parrhesia?Extinction? Not quite. Remember free association. But it was somehow expelled from the mainstream of performing reasoning.Two keywords also worth noticing: brainstorm and groupthink. Modern form and side-effects?This should be interesting for people studying history of mentality.--------------I realized that by hitting the right link and following the right rss feed people still could read everything I have written, despite my privacy settings.Well.

I don't know how much this corresponds to the present, but you hear on the news how the middle class is disappearing, the rich are getting richer and the poorer are getting poorer, and now all of a sudden there is cause for alarm because Aristotle says this is how nations become unraveled!The entire time Aristotle was talking about the ideal state, I really got the feeling of where he considered himself in the hierarchy - as part of the elite. He talked about the polity but to me it felt like he was placating to the poor and middle class so as to maintain the current system, and not for the sake of it being the best state. A good example would be when he talked about farmers not having the time to work in government versus the rich who do, so the rich will rule and the poor and middle classes will be able to scrutinize without having the time or resources to get involved. It seems this is a more practical way to look at a society. We want to believe that we live in a place where everyone has a vote and we're all equal, but like Aristotle says, we're not equal. People with money and education are worth more to a state than a poor person with no education.Well that's kind of depressing. Reading this book makes me want to hide in the comfort of eastern philosophy where we are all one, where the illusion of ego and status melt away and all we are left with is a single consciousness.What else. There are a lot of subjects to tackle after reading this book, but I'll stop here. I admire what Aristotle was able to put together. On a separate note, in Plato's ""Crito"", Socrates provides his reasons for not fleeing Athens after the court decided to put him to death. I wonder what Aristotle's argument would have been (I want the 'sin against philosophy' argument flushed out) for running away. I don't know why, but at a basic level Socrates seems to have more virtue for staying and facing death.

18,18,Robert Davis,"Aristotle speaks through the ages in his classic Politics. Many of his observations, especially those on education, were prescient and are as relevant today as they were 2400 years ago. Aristotle examines different kinds of government and the advantages and dangers of each. He includes insight into many of the problems of democratic government that would be left unsolved for 2000 years- and some that remain unsolved. Aristotle not only predicts the dangers of socialism and communism, but also their downfalls. He examines public spirit, justice, and the meaning of life. This book is a rare watershed moment of in the study human nature. While Aristotle's attempts to understand the scientific underpinnings of the universe via philosophy have been disproved, his philosophical and logical examinations of man, the political animal, are timeless and relevant in an age when short-lived mini-philosophies and faux-profundity pass for intellectual undertakings.

If politicians would read something else instead of this book, maybe things would have been very different than now. No wonder, that 'war' has been usually the determinate factor of the natural and normal discourses and traditions up until now.Why is Aristotle so obsessed with determining the 'natural state' of 'everything'? As if, as soon as they reach the natural state of everything (the natural that Aristotle wants) things will be in balance and equality! and humans will live happily ever after (with slaves of course). No wonder he was the teacher of Alexander III of Macedon (a.k.a great) the greatest murderer in human history.

I'm sure there is troves of important information among these pages of gobbledygook, but I think Aristotle was just too galaxy brained for it to be comprehensible to the modern reader. I think I learned more about Politics from Cliffnotes and Sparknotes than Aristotle's own words.My fellow tutorial classmates warned me that they hated this book going into it, having read it in previous classes. Sadly, I now agree with them. My heart goes out to any future political science/philosophy students that will have to endure this madness.

22,22,ziombel,"The work of Aristotle is a good source about the types of regimes prevailing in antiquity. The author describes both the disadvantages and the advantages of such regimes. The interesting thing is that in many places you can see that socialism and its related ideas are nothing new, because the author repeatedly mentions even with regimes that tried to set the equality of humans or plunder the rich to the poor. If someone is interested in various forms of governance in ancient Greece is recommended if you do not I do not recommend. According to me it is worth to pay attention to several issues:1. Authorisation of slavery people who are slaves by nature. Unfortunately, Aristotle did not write exactly why nature allows some people to servitude, but not others. Human nature is one and we are all humans, unless someone wants to voluntarily relinquish their rights. Therefore, there should be no tolerance for slavery.2. According to the author percent is bad, because according to him money using the percentage born themselves, which is contrary to nature. I would like to post here a series of profanity expressing my indignation at this idiocy, but it is not the right place. Unfortunately, in the times of Aristotle, there was no such thing as Economics, so people usually regarded percent for evil, but it is not. What then is the percentage? The percentage is premium for the risk and the payment for refraining from consumption by the lender. The Austrian School of Economics (ASE) functions such concept as ""time preference"". It is a measure of how people covet The present-day goods over future goods. A person with a low time preference is willing to save more, or refrain present consumption in favor of future profits. Person with a high time preference is just the opposite, that is more likely to spend more and take debt at the expense of future consumption. Savings of people with low time preference are then invested or deposited in the bank(in my deliberations I not included the creation of money out of nothing by the State, because it is a separate topic). As a result, a person with a higher time preference can take out a loan. And percentage is pay for refraining from consumption by the holder. If I lend someone 1000 $, and this person return money to me in a week, rather no one sees nothing wrong with that. But if I borrow 1000 $ someone and that person will give me the exact 1000 $ in 10 years, then you consider that it is okay? But the creditor can not use this money for a long time. In addition, there is no guarantee that the person will return it to him. Thus, in addition, such a person also needs premium for the risk because not all the debtors are solvency. Additionally saving supports capital accumulation, allowing more advanced investments and production of increasingly sophisticated goods. Without this, there would be practically no development. Western Europe is much richer than Africa, thanks to a much earlier start of the accumulation of capital, which was made possible by a change in people's thinking. This led to the Industrial Revolution and a significant increase in the wealth of all people. I do not see anything unfair in charging interest.3. Aristotle said at one point that as we have righteous people in power, they would give the power voluntarily to people more virtuous. It is of course absurd. Why would anyone voluntarily waive privileges to someone else?4. Aristotle in one place called the view that democracy is equivalent to freedom. This is not true. Freedom lies in the fact that anyone can do what they want until they violate the freedom of others. On the other hand democracy is that form different groups and the largest group (not the majority of citizens as Democrats say) imposes its will on others and rob them. Of course, other groups may seize power, but it will lead only to change the direction of looting. Democracy obviously leads to a desire to impose own will to others and the looting of all by all, which has been well described in The Law written by Frédéric Bastiat, which I recommend to read. Someone may ask, of course, that if democracy is bad, what to replace it. In my opinion the best will be the minimum state that took care about a police, legal system, the military and foreign policy. Such state should be prohibited from interfering in the private affairs of the people and the economy. And the way how it will choose the officials, which will obviously be very few(whether by voting citizens, or something else) is secondary.5. The last thing I want here to keep reminding Aristotle, is the desire to repair people by state education. Why would philosopher impose to me his values? In recent times it appeared several such men (Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Mao, etc.) who have tried to implement this idea and it ended tragically. Each of us is different and professes different values. Besides, who is to decide what is virtuous and what is not? It is impossible to unify people, because the majority will always reject this values and the only way is to send such people to gulags and concentration camps. It is better to let people act and do not interfere as long as one does not violate the freedom of others. I recommend to read The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism written by Ayn Rand.There were many other things that can give cancer but I decided that I will no refer to them because they are less cancer-giving.//polishDzieło Arystotelesa jest dobrym źródłem o rodzajach ustrojów panujących w starożytności. Autor opisuje zarówno wady, jak i zalety takich ustrojów. Ciekawą rzeczą jest to, że w wielu miejscach widać że socjalizm i jej pokrewne idee nie są niczym nowym, ponieważ autor wielokrotnie wspomina choćby o ustrojach, które próbowały ustawić równość u ludzi lub też grabić bogatych na rzecz biednych. Jeśli kogoś interesują różne formy rządzenia w starożytnej Grecji to polecam, jeśli nie to nie polecam. Według mnie warto jednak zwrócić uwagę na kilka kwestii:1. Pozwolenie na niewolnictwo ludzi, którzy są niewolnikami z natury. Niestety Arystoteles nie napisał dokładnie dlaczego natura jednych ludzi pozwala na zniewolenie, a innych nie. Ludzka natura jest jedna i wszyscy jesteśmy ludźmi, chyba że ktoś chce dobrowolnie zrzec swoich praw. Dlatego nie powinno być przyzwolenia na niewolnictwo.2. Według autora procent jest zły, ponieważ według niego pieniądze za pomocą procentu rodzą się same, co jest sprzeczne z naturą. Chciałbym zamieścić tutaj serię wulgaryzmów wyrażających moje oburzenie na ten idiotyzm, jednak nie jest to odpowiednie miejsce. Niestety w czasach Arystotelesa nie było czegoś takiego jak Ekonomia, więc ludzie zazwyczaj uważali procent za zło, jednak tak nie jest. Czym w takim razie jest procent? Procent jest premią za ryzyko oraz zapłatą za powstrzymanie się od konsumpcji przez pożyczkodawcę. W Austriackiej Szkole Ekonomii(ASE) funkcjonuje takie pojęcie jak ""preferencja czasowa"". Jest to miara tego, jak ludzie pożądają dobra teraźniejsze nad przyszłymi. Osoba z niską preferencją czasową jest skłonna więcej oszczędzać, czyli powstrzymywać się teraźniejszej konsumpcji na rzecz przyszłej. U osoby z wysoką preferencją czasową jest na odwrót, czyli jest bardziej skłonna do wydawania i zadłużania się kosztem przyszłej konsumpcji. Oszczędności osoby o niskiej preferencji czasowej są później inwestowane lub też odkładane w banku(w swoich rozważaniach nie uwzględniam tworzenia pieniądza z niczego przez państwo, ponieważ jest to osobny temat). Dzięki temu osoba z wyższą preferencją czasową może wziąć pożyczkę. I procent właśnie jest zapłatą za powstrzymanie się od konsumpcji przez oszczędzającego. Jeśli pożyczę komuś 1000 zł, a ta osoba za tydzień mi je odda, to raczej nikt nie widzi w tym nic złego. Ale jeśli pożyczę komuś 1000 zł a ta osoba odda mi dokładnie 1000 zł za 10 lat, to uważacie że to jest w porządku? Przecież wierzyciel nie może korzystać z tych pieniędzy przez długi czas. Dodatkowo nie ma gwarancji na to, że ta osoba mu to zwróci. Zatem dodatkowo taka osoba potrzebuje także premii za ryzyko, ponieważ nie wszyscy jej dłużnicy będą wypłacalni. Dodatkowo oszczędzanie wspomaga akumulację kapitału, co umożliwia coraz bardziej zaawansowane inwestycje i produkcje coraz bardziej zaawansowanych dóbr. Bez tego nie było by praktycznie rozwoju. Choćby zachodnia Europa jest znacznie bogatsza od Afryki właśnie dzięki znacznie wcześniejszemu rozpoczęciu akumulacji kapitału, co było możliwe dzięki zmianie myślenia ludzi. To doprowadziło do rewolucji przemysłowej i do znacznego wzrostu bogactwa wszystkich ludzi. Nie widzę nic niesprawiedliwego w pobieraniu procentu.3. Arystoteles stwierdził w jednym miejscu, że jak będziemy mieli cnotliwych ludzi przy władzy, to oddadzą oni władzę dobrowolnie ludziom bardziej cnotliwym. Jest to oczywiście absurdalne. Dlaczego ktoś miałby dobrowolnie zrzec się przywilejów na rzecz kogoś innego?4. Arystoteles w jednym miejscu przywołał pogląd, według którego demokracja jest równoważna z wolnością. Nie jest to prawdą. Wolność polega na tym, że każdy może robić sobie co chce dopóki nie narusza wolności innych. Natomiast demokracja polega na tym, że formują się różne grupy i największa grupa(nie większość obywateli jak to mówią demokraci) narzuca swoją wolę wszystkim innym i grabi ich. Oczywiście inne grupy mogą przejąć władzę, ale doprowadzi to tylko do zmiany kierunku grabieży. Demokracja w oczywisty sposób prowadzi do chęci narzucania swojej woli oraz grabieży wszystkich przez wszystkich, co zostało dobrze opisane w The Law napisanym przez Frédéric Bastiat, które polecam przeczytać. Ktoś może oczywiście zapytać, że skoro demokracja jest zła, to czym ją zastąpić. Według mnie najlepsze będzie państwo minimum, które zajmowało by się policją, systemem prawnym, wojskiem oraz polityką zagraniczną. Takie państwo powinno mieć zakaz mieszania się w prywatne sprawy ludzi oraz w gospodarkę. A to, jak będzie wybierać się urzędników, których będzie oczywiście bardzo niewielu(czy to przez głosowanie obywateli, czy coś innego) jest sprawą drugorzędną.5. Ostatnią rzeczą którą chcę tutaj wypomnieć Arystotelesowi, jest chęć naprawy człowieka przez państwową edukację. Dlaczego jakiś filozof miałby narzucać mi wyznawane przez mnie wartości? W ostatnich czasach pojawiło się kilku takich panów(Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Mao itd) którzy próbowali zrealizować tą ideę i zakończyło się to tragicznie. Każdy z nas jest inny i wyznaje inne wartości. Poza tym kto ma decydować o tym, co jest cnotliwe a co nie? Nie da się ujednolicić ludzi, ponieważ zawsze większość będzie się temu opierała i jedynym wyjściem będzie wysyłanie takich ludzi do gułagów i obozów zagłady. Lepiej pozwolić ludziom działać i nie ingerować dopóki nikt nie narusza wolności innych. Polecam przeczytać Cnota egoizmu napisaną przez Ayn Rand.Było jeszcze wiele innych rakogennych fragmentów ale uznałem, że nie będę się do nich odnosił, ponieważ są mniej rakogenne.

24,24,Matt,"The final thought that Aristotle leaves us in Nicomachean Ethics is the main source of tension in The Politics. The goal of existence in Nicomachean Ethics is happiness which can be achieved through the contemplative life, but Aristotle is rooted in Greek culture and cannot conceive of happiness outside the city-state. His opening line in The Politics sets his baseline:  Since we see that every city is some sort of partnership, and that every partnership is constituted for the sake of some good (for everyone does everything for the sake of what is held to be good), it is clear that all partnerships aim at some good, and that the partnership that is most authoritative of all and embraces all the others does so particularly, and aims at the most authoritative good of all. This is what is called the city or political partnership. Pg. 36/ 1252al.  The city is thus the vehicle for goodness (aka virtue) which leads to the contemplative life and therefore happiness. Aristotle, like all of us, cannot escape all of his societal conditioning. This foundational belief that the city is a partnership designed to lead to good is grounded in the oft-quoted “man is a political animal“ or, more accurately, “man is much more a political animal than any kind of bee or and herd of animal is clear.” Pg. 37. An idea Marx latched onto. This lack of separation between the individual’s pursuit of contemplation and study and natural social tendencies is the underlying principle of The Politics. This is not a political book espousing freedom, productivity or the perpetuation of some other code. It is about constructing a state designed to survive and permit its citizens leisure.  Since the end is evidently the same for human beings both in common and privately, and there must necessarily be the same defining principle for the best man and the best regime, it is evident that the virtues directed to leisure should be present; for, as has been said repeatedly, peace is the end of war, and leisure of occupations. Pg. 222/VII ch.15; 10-15.  Much of what is contained within its pages is not meant to be a theoretical rendering of government. Aristotle spends considerable time attacking the flaws he sees in Plato’s Republic and Laws. Just as Nicomachean Ethics was a book about “practical” ethics, The Politics is about “practical” politics. Again, Aristotle sees great value in the mean as a way of traversing problems that arise at the extremes of political positions. He puts great value on the middle class as a stabilizing force and a way to undercut discontent. Aristotle’s goal is to minimize corruption, maximize stability and encourage correct thinking which is thinking that sees value in the contemplative life. Unlike Plato, he refuses to ignore what he perceives as the realistic consequences of division of property and labor. Poorly apportioned equity can lead to sloth and discontent.Overall, if Aristotle was alive today, he’s the guy behind the scenes as some presidential advisor. He has an idea of what government should do, but he refuses to let his ideals rule his actions. He compares other forms of government, what’s worked, what hasn’t worked, and comes to a thoughtful analysis of what will get him closest to his goal of happiness. Few will probably read The Politics and come away with any great insights into governance, but Aristotle’s method is admirable. Though not above his times, he is a masterful deliberator of his times.

25,25,Otto Lehto,"This marvelous book of which many things can be said was 1) the beginning of analytical political science and 2) a critical summation and refinement of the normative political theory of the Greeks (especially Plato). Its achievements are staggering. There is an astronomical amount of fascinating and deliriously analytical content here, from the small to the very big, that has kept generations of scholars very happy (and sometimes very despondent). Aristotle's great strength as a political philosopher is his incredible capacity to distill debates and concepts down to their constituent elements and to expose the weaknesses and internal tensions in commonly accepted arguments. Unfortunately, Politics advocates for consistently harsh views on slavery, the role of women in society, and the hierarchical class structure of the ""virtuous"" society. I do not think it is fair to judge Aristotle's moral views by the standards of our own time; but even by the standards of his own time, Aristotle's view is not especially enlightened. This is especially true in relation to certain disadvantaged groups, including slaves, women, children, workers, the poor... In short, the overwhelming majority of the population (!), whom he considers unfit to rule, unfit for virtue, and unfit for happiness. As much as I admire the entire enterprise of the book, the reactionary elephant in the living room is no small blemish but an extremely insidious flaw in the whole normative system. To his credit, though, the clarity of his arguments allows for easy counterarguments. Detractors who have taken issue with his conclusions do not have to guess about where he went wrong, since Aristotle is crystal clear about his premises, arguments, and conclusions. Aristotle's ethical and political views are very complicated. He makes mincemeat of some of the advocates of tyranny and unlimited mob rule. He showcases the importance of written laws and constitutional principles. He dramatically improves upon the Platonic daydreaming of The Republic and The Laws. Some of Aristotle's political views are moderate or even progressive by the standards of his times. He hints towards a more progressive interpretation of his principles which has been a boon to later scholars who have taken his views on virtue to a different direction. However, there is no going around the fact that his views on class and gender reflect a very conservative, even reactionary, views on human nature. Aristotle not only reflexively believed in, but theoretically emphasized, the importance of social and political hierarchies based on natural inequalities where certain classes of people were excluded on principle. That said, it would be foolish to get hung up on what is old fashioned in a book written a long time ago when there is so much there that is absolutely fantastic, titillating, mind bending, clarifying, illuminating, and revolutionary. Not many books from 2,300 years ago can be said to feel so forward looking in their methodology (if not in their substantive conclusions). Aristotle demanded a rigorously scientific approach to governance and ethics. We should uphold the same tradition by emulating the Aristotelian discipline. The hypnotically compelling analytical precision of his argument impresses technically even when it cuts against our notions of equality and justice. This is not a book; this is the Bible of political science.

29,29,Lucas,"Notes on Politiká1. Previously, on his Ethics, Aristóteles had called politics the true human good. Politiká is in many ways a sort of companion piece of the ethical treaties, perhaps his intended centrepiece. It explores virtues this time in the context of communal life, a sort of macrowork where the previous one was more intimate, more personal. And in spite of it being a centrepiece of sorts, it's nowhere near as good as his Ethics. Has it aged? No doubt, but it'd be silly to expect otherwise. The problem is how Aristóteles, a man of great genius, was ultimately too anchored on his time to go further in his politics. Put him alongside Platón on this topic and he pales in comparison. There's less food for thought here: Politiká is mostly dry description.2. Aristóteles' approach is, as always, systematic. Most of the book deals with countless examples of different types of government. He goes through them one by one, listing their pros and cons, showing how they come to be, how they come to end. While doing so, Aristóteles comes across as a compassionate conservative. I like that. The process drags on. Aristóteles spends too much time simply providing comparing and contrasting. He doesn't look beyond the examples. One can pick the best pages of Politiká easily. He's at his best when he further develops his thelology into the context of politic and natural order. Or when he deals with education to ensure virtuous citizens.3. If Platón gets a bad rap for expelling poets off his ideal city, Aristóteles does so as well for his take on slavery and women. I want to forgive him because it's obviously a product of his time and him, being a compassionate conservative, is bound to defend it. But nonetheless, this restricted view of citizenship, excluding slaves and women, actually hinders his reasoning, something that is not present in Platón.4. At the end of the day, my admiration for Aristóteles has grown after reading his Politiká, those few complains aside. Where Platón was the idealist, Aristóteles was the realist. Aristóteles goes where the real fight is, looking for examples of real states and their failures, to try and grasp how things should be ordered. I'd take this one as the best introduction to politics out there, almost a perfect textbook on the different types of government, the state powers, citizenship, revolutions, all you need to know on the subject. Politiká is indeed too long, but its best pages are essential.

30,0,Matt,"As Plato’s writings have been a cornerstone of Western thought, so have those of his pupil Aristotle through his own lectures and treatise sometimes agreed and disagreed with his teacher while shaping the views of millions over the millennia. Politics is one of the most important political treatise that has impacted society as it is studied alongside Plato’s own Republic not because they agree, but how they agree through different methods and disagree in conclusions.Unlike the approach of Plato, Aristotle focused on the examples that the Greek political world knew of to determine the best approach for government of a polis. Classifying the types of government into six forms, three “ideal” and three “perverted”, Aristotle described them as showing their pros and cons in an effort to establish the “best”. Then his analysis turned to various functions of government from laws, offices, and how to pass or fill either. Yet, underlying everything is Aristotle’s insistence that human nature determines everything concerned with governance.Politics, while thought-provoking and significant in its analysis and conclusions, is unfortunately not without its flaws. The biggest is Aristotle’s argument of natural rulers and natural slaves that is so opposite to the way many think today. The next biggest is that fact that the overall work seems like it is not coherently organized or even complete as many aspects that Aristotle says he will cover never appear and he writes about the bringing about his conclusive best government before actually proving what it is, though given his argument that the best government for a polis depends on how its population is constructed.Aristotle’s Politics is at the same both thought-provoking and maddening especially given the soundness of his analysis and the disorganized state of the overall treatise. Yet it is one of the most important treatises of political thought of the Western world and is significant in political and historical terms as it has been influential for millennia.

Sadly, while slavery had been abolished or criminalized in most part of the world, nevertheless modern slavery still exist. Meaning we as human race still don't get it that enslaving fellow human beings for whatever reason is wrong.I agree with Aristotle that democracy while not the best form of governance is far better than the alternatives--monarchy or tyranny (I would add anarchism). Similarly, capitalism while not the best economics system is far better than the alternative--socialism.An interesting take from Aristotle in this book is that in order to stabilize the relationship between the rich and the poor classes (that always mistrust of each other) is to keep theses two classes small and in turn to create a larger middle class as a buffer thus lessen the tension among classes. What a clever bugger, Aristotle was to think of that.

34,4,Galicius,"Book ICommunities and states are established to bring the greatest good to its members. Qualifications of a king and master or householder are not the same as some (Plato) think. It’s not just the number of subjects they have to deal with. A statesman is also different and he rules when citizens set up a government and rule by political science. But there are different kinds of rule.Aristotle goes no to consider the relationship between master and slave, absolute and relative meaning of the terms. He questions whether slavery is indeed natural and compares warfare to hunting of wild animals. He points out that the Greeks consider themselves free men everywhere but don’t consider barbarians the same way. Barbarians are only free in their own land. He begins consideration of property and wealth getting both that which is necessary like obtaining food and managing household and the unnecessary type like unlimited gathering of coin or other property. Men confuse their goal of living well which has a limit of how much wealth it requires with that by which they become absorbed with acquiring wealth and property and loose sight of their original aim. Their desire becomes unlimited and unnecessary. There is a natural way of gathering wealth from fruits and animals or land or sea. The other way or retail trade is not natural. The “most hated sort” is usury which makes money out of money itself—“of all modes of getting wealth this is the most unnatural”.Theorizing about wealth getting may be worthy of philosophy but in practice such discussion may be irksome.There are three occupations in wealth getting: husbandry and farming; exchange, commerce, usury; mining.Aristotle gives two examples of financial speculation where one man created a monopoly of wine presses, and another a monopoly in iron. A husband and father rules over his wife and children, and as master over his slaves. “For although there may be exceptions to the order of nature the male is fitter to command than the female, just as the elder…to the younger and more immature.Aristotle raises the question whether there is any excellence and virtue in a slaves and women. If they “share in rational principle” it’s absurd to think they have one and should be ruled instead of ruling also.The ruler too can be unjust, cowardly and will not rule well. Both the ruler and subject have virtue but varying. Socrates said, “the temperance of a man and of a woman…are not the same…or the courage and justice”. All classes have their “special attributes”. He quotes Sophocles from Ajax: “Silence is a woman’s glory”. Masters should be a “source…of excellence” to the slave and not employ command only.The virtues of a family are supposed to make a difference in the virtue of the state. Aristotle will “examine the various theories of the perfect state” next.

35,5,Atratzu Talgala,"Why I wanted this book:I consider myself something of a slight armchair philosopher. I heard enough philosophy growing up that I definitely agree that the “unexamined life is not worth living.” I’ve combed the internet for free resources and checked out various lectures online. As an armchair philosopher I thought it kind of funny I didn’t even own any philosophy books… not proper philosophical-thought-books anyway, because naturally there are philosophies in the background of all that we say, do, see, read, etc.So I wanted to take the next step and pick up a philosophy book. Where better to start then the Ancient Greeks? I’m fairly familiar with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle and that they are sometimes considered the foundation for western thought. However I’m not entirely certain this was the best book to start with, and would probably be better suited to read in a scholastic setting where questions would be asked during a lecture or after reading a section and there was a teacher specializing in ancient greek culture on hand.All that to say I got in over my head with this book. I’m not going to pretend that “ah yes, this book is rich and finely decorated” much like the emperor’s clothes. I struggled paying attention while I was reading and tried different methods to keep my attention on what I was reading. (A friend suggested I keep notes in a notebook, so that’s what I did and worked the best.)I’ll do my best to articulate my opinion on this book… but I’m afraid I have trouble recounting what I actually read. I have a notebook full of notes from 1313a11 to 1342b7. But without those notes I could tell you nothing about what I read just days after reading it.

I don’t know why they’re called books instead of chapters, I suspect this has something to do with translation from greek… It might also be because the topic changes, but not until you’ve worked your way into that chapter. Oftentimes I found the thought continuing from chapter to chapter… Again, I found the organizational method very puzzling and distracting.The book is also organized by some set of numbers and letters which are related to the translation, called “Bekker Numbers” I’m sure all of that was very interesting and useful for people properly studying this manuscript and contrasting it with the original greek manuscript, but it just confused me as a casual reader... Especially since the book starts at 1252a1. Presumably meaning Politics by Aristotle starts at “page1252, left column, first line”.General statements about the book:There’s a lot of ideology that Aristotle had on governments and how the they should be run that just really doesn’t make any sense to me and might be best explained by an expert on the subject; Children raised by the state, the different classes (Husbandmen, Artisans, Gaurdians, etc), slavery, and more.However just as there are some confusing and appalling topics there is a lot of progressive thought that you can see influenced today's society. In particular I think of the general question “What is the purpose of government” and Aristotle's answer in book 7 (1328b8) “Let us enumerate the functions of a state, and we shall easily elicit what we want: first, there must be food; secondly, arts for life requires many instruments; thirdly, there must be arms, for the members of a community have need of them, and in their own hands, too, in order to maintain authority both against disobedient subjects and against external assailants; fourthly, there must be a certain amount of revenue, both for internal needs, and for purpose of war; fifthly, or rather first, there must be a care of religion, which is commonly called worship; sixthly, and most necessary of all, there must be a power of deciding what is for the public interest, and what is just in men’s dealings with one another”.It sure makes “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness” in the united states declaration of independence seem so much more succinct, doesn’t it?Honestly I feel like it’s difficult to talk about Politics by Aristotle because it’s such an incredible collection of ideas and thoughts that to do it justice you need to spend a lot of time discussing each book individually… Aristotle covers: What is a government/state? What form does politics take? The types of governments, what governments are good, what governments are bad,responses to governments from other city-states in the area, Education, public education, should children learn music? Aristotle uses analogies and comparisons to mathematics/geometry, and even musical modes “Dorrian is the manliest mode” according to Aristotle at 1342b7.I’m tempted to try to break each chapter into a topic and theme… but that’s very challenging for some sections of the book. Sometimes it feels like I’m reading a lecture, other times it feels like I’m reading the ranting of an old man, still other times I can understand why people are mesmerized by Aristotle's teachings. I feel like I ran the gauntlet of opinions throughout this book.Conclusion:So, I’ve said a lot of words about this book… what’s my conclusion? My final thoughts?I think that this book is an excellent collection of ideas. Some, I like. Some, I dislike. My experience with philosophy has always been a mixed bag of opinions and ideas that I agree with and disagree with. The value in philosophy for me is learning why I think what I think and being able to articulate that accurately and discuss it respectfully.So I pose more of these types of questions to myself: Did I learn anything? Was I exposed to new ideas? Was there value in reading Aristotle (outside of any worthless self-esteem “bragging rights”)? Easy answer: Yes.HOWEVER, I think I will need to return to this book someday and review it. I don’t think I have a strong enough foundation for my study of philosophy to properly appreciate all that is being discussed in this book. Again, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m not really understanding some of the key themes and topics addressed in this book, but I’m sure I’ll eventually crack it back open and try again.That’s the wonderful thing about learning and knowledge… it builds on itself. You need to learn basic mathematics before you try Geometry or Algebra. Politics by Aristotle might have been a bit too far of a jump for my current understanding but you’ll never know how you stack up unless you try. Besides, Aristotle can’t come get me and yell at me for not really understanding his writings very well. ...Just don’t tell his fans about me.

But, if all communities aim at some good, the state or political community, which is the highest of all, and which embraces all the rest, aims, and in a greater degree than any other, at the highest good."" from Book I I read this book for one of my political science classes and it marks my introduction to Aristotle. I have to say that despite his technical, opaque language it was a very good very informative read on how and why politics is created. This book is not as difficult as I thought it would be but it is not the warming receptive narrative of Plato. I won't go into detailed breakdown of every part of this treatise but the important points. The first point is that humans are political animals by nature because we have he ability for (sophisticated) speech and reason. The second thing is the idea of there being ""good"" forms of government and ""bad"" forms of government. The ""good"" forms of government are monarchy, aristocracy, and constitutional/polity. The ""bad"" forms of government are tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy. He spends a lot of time detailing different forms and examples of all of these types of government. For this project Aristotle spent years gathering information and surveying many all of the city-states in Greece and the ""barbarian"" countries outside of Greece. Despite living around Athens he believes Sparta (aristocracy) to be the best administered state in the Hellas. This was one of the most ambitious political science research projects in history to that point and it deserves the honor that it gets.

37,7,Maria," Aristotle, as well as Plato, holds that individuals aren't but part of a community, does not give rise to women in public, comparing them with slaves. Justifying slavery with nature, justifying all social malaise, responding to an anti democratic way of thinking, hence the need to say who is a citizen and who is not. Author atrocious, proving the insanity of the times before Christ, and the urgent need to revise more democratic and fairer systems. it's very clear how classical authors tends to think the politics in an organic way, understanding society as if it was a body, where each part has a specific funcion, where the whole precedes the parts, and the city is prior to man. Interesting book, not very clear if you don't read Plato before, and if you don't complements with classic contractualists after, the importance lies in getting the complete idea.

39,9,Xander,"Meant to serve as Part 2 in a lecture course, Politica is Aristotle's treatment of the State. As with everything he wrote and taught, the fundamental notion is his hylemorphism - the doctrine that everything consists of matter and form, and combined they serve some purpose or goal. The state consists of its citizens, as well as slaves and non-citizens (women, foreigners, etc.), and its form is the particular regime that orders society - i.e. its structure, institutions, laws and basically its power distribution. A citizen is someone who is able to rule and to be ruled, requiring a liberal education and hence leisure time to cultivate this virtuous disposition. As with everything Aristotle wrote, Politica is occupied with endless distinctions and differentiations. For example, Aristotle distinguishes six types of regime, based on the rule of one, some and many and the corruption or benefit of the political order. The good regimes are monarchy, aristocracy and polity; the bad ones are tyranny, oligarchy and democracy. While acknowledging that the best regime is a monarchy with an englightened despot (a 'pan basilea'), Aristotle also acknowledges that this type of regime is practically unrealistic - even if its instituted it is inherently stable due to factions waiting for a power grab. According to Aristotle, the most common types of regime are oligarchy and democracy - the rule of the rich and the rule of the power. The former leads to domination by those who own property, concluding that since some inequality exists, everything should be unequal. The latter leads to domination by those who are poor and destitute, who pander to demagogues, and conclude that since some equality exists, everything should be equal. As with the ideal state (i.e. the rule of an enlightened despot) factions are inevitable - different groups are on the hunt for offices that contain power and honour. In both types of regime the people and the elites are grabbing for power. Which leads Aristotle to claim that the best possible type of regime is one that combines oligarchy and democracy. The statesman should formulate laws that balance the power between the different factions, while the rulers should educate themselves in practical wisdom (phronesis), i.e. learning to distinguish, judge and act in the best interest of the community as a whole.This last remark is important. Aristotle sees the polity as an entity in itself, with its own purpose: the happiness (eudaimonia) of its citizens. This means that individual freedom is only secondary - the statesman should always keep the common good in his view.As a matter of fact, the whole Politica is sort of a handbook for the statesman. It oultines how he should govern and ensure that peace and stability are kept. Aristotle studies historical and contemporary societies to find the different types of constitutions, their peculiar strengths and weaknesses, and the particular dangers that threaten each type of regime. This is all done so that the statesman always knows how to respond appropriately to a situation. In the event of internal or external chaos, his goal is the speedy normalization of society, and here he is allowed to set traditions and laws aside. Aristotle recognizes the dangers of this: it breaks instituted habits and leads the people to openness to other ways of living. Yet context matters and sometimes the statesman needs room to manoeuvre in order to deal with threats. This makes Aristotle a relativistic conventionalist, in the sense that he both recognizes the multiplicity of possibilities for states to exist as well as the need to adhere to instituted traditions. (This, by the way, goes deeply against doctrines of later thinkers, like Hobbes, Weber, Machiavelli and Schmidt, who depart from extreme situations, like civil war, in order to build their theories of statesmanship. Aristotle departs from the stable normal situation, views conflicts as departures from convention, and sees the normalization as final goal.)The Politica is an interesting book, yet it is not well-structured and one feels very lost when diving into it. There is not a good strategy to read it - the book consists of endless referrals to earlier or later portions and the sequence of topics feels random at times. The most interesting parts (for me) were Aristotle's analyses of contemporary societies, in which he outlines all kinds of events and their underlying patterns. So this makes this book both a guide to obtain practical wisdom (as a statesman) as a historical source of ancient societies and customs. (Leaving aside how reliable Aristotle's sources and how non-partisan his descriptions were).It is an interesting book, especially after reading Ethica Nicomachea - there is some overlap between both works and some extension of prior topics - but I doubt if the Politica would spark some interest in the average modern reader.

40,10,Frank Stein,"This book reminds me of why I remain a modernist. The so-called classics do contain nuggets of wisdom, but the good parts have often already been incorporated in our thought, and the extraneous parts, of which there are many, have rightfully been ignored as thought marches onward and more and better evidence accumulates. Thus Aristotle's ""The Politics"" is of historical interest. It gives insight into what Greeks thought, and how their thought evolved into our modern theories of politics, but one will not find original insights into politics beyond the Greek isles around the 4th century BC. At its best, however, the book provides a sort of hidden genealogy of modern political thought. Aristotle spends much time dilating on the benefits of a ""mixed constitution"" of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy, but he leaned towards what he called a politeia (the same word as constitution), which constituted broad participation by a prosperous middle class. His belief that ""like should be treated alike,"" meant that he thought free men should all rule in turn, and should be chosen partially by vote and partially by lot, since even election would lend to the favoritism to a few. He wanted to both pay the poor to attend assemblies and also fine aristocrats for not attending them, to ensure the balance of interest in politics. You can see why James Madison liked him. At the end of Book IV Aristotle even divides government into a ""deliberative part,"" a""sovereign part,"" and a ""judicial part,"" a division that, although it does not quite map onto our modern one (especially because the deliberative element also appointed officials, while officials themselves had some authority to ""make laws"" and ""give orders"" and seemed almost sovereign in themselves), has obvious parallels. In Book III Chapter 11 Aristotle even makes a surprising argument for the wisdom of crowds by noting that ""each individual will indeed be a worse judge than the experts, but collectively they will be better,"" since they will all brings aspects of individual wisdom to bear. He mentions it as a defense of democracy.The book is also a helpful reminder that Greece was such a hothouse of ideas because it was a hothouse of different states and cities. Some cities elected by lot, some by family, some by vote, some by co-option, and many had combinations of all of these. Some gave citizenship to almost all, some to only soldiers, and many gave it to those with different property qualifications, with weights depending on how much people had. There were also an infinitude of ideal states, from Plato's the Republic, with its elite class of ""Guardians,"" and his The Laws, to Hippodamus's plan for a 10,000 person state with defenders sustained out of the public land. Luckily, Aristotle tends too much to the empirical and cataloguing sort of mind to go in much for ideals. He does discuss in the Book VII how age-groups should occupy different positions throughout their lives, how a powerful city should not be too large or too small, but should encompass access to the sea and trade, how only those with leisure (schule) should be free citizens, how inheritance laws should ensure broad and not concentrated ownership, how agricultural workers should be slaves, how Hippodamian regular streets should be combined with old-fashioned warrens to thwart invaders, and so forth. But on the whole he attacks, for instance, Plato and Phaleas for refusing to make amends for real-world issues, and for dreaming of only common property and common wives. Aristotle defends the value of diverse viewpoints and balanced constitutions. He is therefore the true founder of modern liberal theory. I just wish a modern editor had taken a hacking to most of the book.

41,11,Aaron Crofut,"A skim read; after sixteen years, it seemed worth the time to brush up on what the Philosopher had to say on politics, especially given how different politics in this nation have become since my sophomore year in college. Every young person catching the politics bug should take the time to read this book. The basics are all there. Other reviews will cover that for you. Again, this was a skim review for me; I wanted to remember some things lost and see what my mind would focus on different this time. What I came away with was this: * Man is a political animal. That's more than ""we take part in politics."" Much of who we become, our language, our culture, our ethics, our customs do not unfold from us sui generis. I was rather fortunate to be reading Dietrich von Hildebrand along with Aristotle. We need to evaluate our culture against an objective standard rather than taking that culture as the standard. At the same time, we cannot be hypercritical about these matters, either. Our polis needs to be maintained. Aristotle would appreciate the mean needed between blind acceptance and blind criticism of that which we inherit and should pass on to our offspring. * What is a city, a polis, a nation? The seem to be like rivers, the parts always changing and yet the whole always remaining. Yet if enough of the parts change, perhaps the whole ceases to be what it is. And the parts do change. The United States has changed considerably. It will continue to do so. But what are the essential elements that should not change, that if we changed them we would cease to be what we were? I think this is the big issue of our day. It's more than the libertarian social contract between people. * Friendship as a political value. This pops up a couple of times. I find it interesting that he specifically mention the threat of a small ruling class closing itself off to ""friendship"" with the lower classes, especially in marriage. The rulers are to rule with charity towards the ruled. That's unlikely to happen where the rulers see the ruled as foreigners. * The polis has a teleological end, something more than the social contract of Locke. Eudomnia, happiness, requires the city, and the city is aimed at that end. Passing on culture is an important aspect of that goal. * Causes of faction. I'm just going to refer the reader to Book V, Chapter 3. Some of those issues are at play today. * The three values a person needs to hold office: loyalty to constitution, capacity to do the job, and character (with an emphasis on justice). Does anyone running for President meet all three of those? * Perhaps the most important point of the work is in Book VII: politics is a means to an end, not an end in itself. * The point of education is not techne, but epistime. It is not just knowing how to do things, but in knowing itself.

42,12,David,"I began the book thinking Aristotle might have been progressive for his age. I now question that. He lived in a society which could be called progressive for its time - being a ""democracy"" for slaveholders. But Aristotle's reasoning strikes me as elitist justification for the status quo. At least in the translation I read, I found the text full of long, complex sentences with many clauses - perhaps like 19th century German scholars such as Max Weber's sentences.He argues that it is appropriate for people to be kept in a social class which is consistent with their abilities. Those whose capabilities are in physical strength are best suited to be slaves, and others are more suited to be slaveholders. But even if one accepts the general premises, a serious philosophical examination would raise questions about the real society he's defending. Aristotle doesn't criticize his society because it didn't test all children to determine each individual's abilities and then place them in the appropriate social class. Or, suppose a person's strengths and weaknesses best suited him for manual labor. Does it follow the same must be true of his children and grandchildren? A racist view might say yes, but did Aristotle's society occassionally say, ""This child of a slave is physically weak and has other characteristics more in common with another class, therefore he must be made free and given a fitting place in society? Was there never a child of a slaveholder who was strong, but not so smart?In Book I, Chapter IX:...for which reason it should seem that some boundary should be set to riches, though we see the contrary to this is what is practised; for all those who get riches add to their money without end; ... economy requires the possession of wealth, but not on its own account but with another view, to purchase things necessary therewith; but the other procures it merely to increase it: so that some persons are confirmed in their belief, that this is the proper object of economy, and think that for this purpose money should be saved and hoarded up without end; ... and if they cannot [endlessly increase wealth] merely by the art of dealing in money, they will endeavour to do it by other ways, and apply all their powers to a purpose they were not by nature intended for. Thus, for instance, courage was intended to inspire fortitude, not to get money by; neither is this the end of the soldier's or the physician's art, but victory and health. But such persons make everything subservient to money-getting, as if this was the only end; and to the end everything ought to refer.So, while Aristotle says wealth for wealth's sake is wrong, he seems to direct this more to people not of the slave-holding leisure class. In Politics, Aristotle expresses the idea that slaveholders have talents in managing slaves. I would think that doctors and trades people do more to earn their money, and (while I don't encourage mercenaries) one might think soldiers or others who risk their lives deserve more than those who give instructions to laborers.[Reading C. Wright Mills' The Power Elite, Mills tells how the ""old money"" elite look down upon the ""new money"" rich. It struck me: this sounds like Aristotle's attitude towards those who built their wealth on something other than slavery.](I don't actually know the answer, but I question whether the average slaveholder really knew more about the art of agriculture, in order to give superior instructions, than the average slave.)In Chapter XIII, he argues that slaves and women aren't devoid of virtues, but they are inherently of a different amount and type. For instance, it's inherent in the man to command and inherent in women to obey. (Did Aristotle know of Sappho who lived 200 years before him?) Aristotle writes, a slave should ""be trained to those virtues which are proper for his situation by his master.""I only read Book I and the beginning of Book II, but I think that was enough for my particualr purposes.

43,13,'Izzat Radzi,"I read this in concurrent with Cicero's De Republica, hence the time taken much longer and perhaps the frame of mind is different. In addition to that, as from the Preface, I read this starting from Book I-III, then VII-VIII and only then finished the remaining book.Maybe if I read it in a different way, or from a different publication (like the one recently published by Princeton) then my understanding of Aristotle's work is different. Truly enlightening read, since it deals with virtue and vice, the golden mean, the relativity of the best constitution in states and perhaps also the illustration of what a tyrant should do (in Book V) can be related to cheap-labor nowadays, where the higher echelons purposely kept the poor people poor to ensure they have to pay the most minimum. Of course, there're some critique on his views on slavery, woman position (and nature, for instance to suggest them to naturally ""always support"" tyrants amongst many others) and some other from Plato's, but I kept it later for further read of his work.Since we're talking about constitution too, it is also best to recollect yesterday UK supreme court (11 judges unanimous) decision of the UK parliament unlawful preroguing.

44,14,Ben,"One of the gifts I received for Christmas, which seems like such a long time ago now, was a £25 voucher to use on amazon. As soon as I saw the three-thousand digit code on the back of the card, I realised that there was only one thing I’d spend all that money on, books. That thought brought on a very rare occasion that I can’t take for granted: I made a rash decision and didn’t regret it. I bought The Collected Works of Plato, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, How to be both, Crime and Punishment, We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, I am Malala, and Aristotle’s Politics. I’ve only just finished reading Politics, and I supposed that there would be no better place to review and reflect on the book than on the blog that I’m using to talk about everything related to PPE.There were many interesting things about this book, both in its ideas and in its references to the ancient world. The most noteworthy point about this entire book though is that it’s clearly a criticism of everything that Plato had earlier written in his dialogues, and therefore Politics set off criticism that must have gone against the grain of popular opinion in the ancient world. To properly enjoy this book, I think it’s worth knowing a little about the history of Aristotle, and his role as a Philosopher. Aristotle was a genius that was heavily influenced by the ideas of Plato; so much so that he joined an institution called the Plato Academy. The Plato Academy was run by Plato himself, and filled with people who were inspired by the early analytical philosophy put forward by Plato, and who were entirely in his debt when it came to their studies. When Plato died and the Academy needed a new head – Aristotle was hopeful, but didn’t manage to get it. This is where I think Aristotle really began to turn away from following Plato, and became more creative and independent in his thought. Thus spoke Politics.If we take it for granted that The Republic was, in Ancient Greece, the most dominant and influential book on the proper order of a state, books I & II should have hit the reader with a sharp shock. In these two books, Aristotle is putting his ideas forward from a theoretical point of view, arguing the necessity of slaves, the position of commodities, children, and the fundamental forms of government. Aristotle agrees with Plato insofar as they are both able to identify Oligarchies, Democracies, Tyrannies, and Aristocracies as forms of government, but Aristotle also expands on this idea. Aristotle doesn’t include a Timocracy as a form of government as Plato did, as it has never truly materialised in any part of the world, but he does add Monarchies to the list, and improves on the definitions of the forms of government completely. The first two books are essentially the first harsh grip on the reader, arguing that there is wisdom in what Plato has taught us about the state, but that he sometimes oversteps his boundaries, and in doing so has ended up creating a state which is essentially against human nature. In the later books, Aristotle becomes more focused on reality; rather than using abstract thought and reasoning to bring the reader to his conclusions, he gives examples from history. When talking about how different states function, Aristotle doesn’t look at how they should function, but rather how they actually have. He references the Spartan state, the Celts, the Lacedemonias as evidence for his arguments, noting how they use their democratic, aristocratic or oligarchic forms on the populates that they raise, and in the final book (book VIII), the focus turns to the education of the youth, and focuses itself on the topics that students should learn in schools. In this manner, it can be argued that Aristotle was one of the first scientists, as he seemingly uses the history of states to provide evidence or disprove earlier hypotheses.I haven’t read any notes on this book, and haven’t had any guidance in my reading, so I may be missing out on some of the major points in thisAris quick overview, but that is how I would describe the contents of Politics to myself before having read this book, and what I’d say to myself as I write this blog post, just to refresh my mind. What is more important at this point is what I took away from the book, and whether I found it a worthwhile read, or whether I should have simply read some notes online and gotten a condensed version of his ideas.What’s really important to consider when reading classics on political science is how similar the ideas of the book are to the society you’re living in today, and from Aristotle’s description of a good and bad state, the function of magistrates and of the division between rich and poor, it’s clear that he has made a huge impact on the way that we view the function of a state from both the ruler’s point of view and from the subject’s point of view. One idea that caught my attention early on in the book was that there are many forms of the different states. A democracy, for example, will have similar features no matter where it is implemented, but won’t be the same from state to state. This is similar to Plato’s theory of forms, only more practical. There are definitions that make a democracy definably different from an oligarchy, but there is no way for a democracy to be implemented in the exact same way across the world, for there are many historical and cultural factors behind mask of these regimes. This may seem like an over exaggeration of common sense, but it was definitely an insight of genius for a high ranking philosopher of Ancient Greece to argue that he can’t explain every action that a state takes.Another surprising idea of Aristotle’s was that there are two extremes on a political spectrum, democracy and oligarchy, and that all other state systems fall somewhere in between these two. This is significant, as it may have been the foundation of what we now call the Right vs Left spectrum. Previously, in The Republic, it was argued that there were five forms of a state, and that countries would switch between them until they were satisfied, and then would switch again, based on the balance of justice. Aristotle added flux to this very static idea, arguing that there are two extremes, and that all civilisations fall somewhere between them: an idea that is still very, very modern.

45,15,Micah Jakubowicz,"4.5 stars. Some VERY important ideas in here. Unfortunately (not all Aristotle’s fault), there are a few extremely outdated ideas. But those only make up about 10% of this beautiful work. However, if you know anything about the history of political philosophy and the history of classical liberalism, (and you’ve never read this work before) you will be happily surprised to see most of the foundations in Aristotle’s Politics. This is the first major work that recognized that a society is ultimately built on individuals, not the collective like Plato thought. To build a reasonable and virtuous society, the individual has to work on themselves first, then the political landscape will eventually become virtuous, for lack of a better term. It is absolutely insane, misleading, and plain immoral to think that government should be the arbiters of truth and morality. Because ultimately, even the top government officials are just as human as we are, and are an equal citizen. Why then, should any government official, or governmental group, feel they have the right to dictate to ME what I should do, and how I should live my life? Enter the Enlightenment!! Enter Liberalism!!!Enter America!!Thank you Aristotle!!Of course I could go on and on about the importance and genius of Aristotle in this work, but suffice it to say, one of the greatest works of political philosophy ever.

46,16,Mr. Banks,"I’ll come up with a better set of takeaways later. Aristotle models the good from his set of ethic developed in the treatise of that name. His argument is that the state is constructed to enable the allow each citizen to pursue the good life. For if every citizen is good, then the state as a whole is good.What then follows is a set of prescriptions to create this good state. Aristotle, as a biologist, loves to characterize and classify, so we are treated to several chapters that define different form of states, their characteristics, and how they should function and survive.As for his proofs, a lot of it follows a consistent set of logic but the axioms, on which they are built, rests on the naturalistic argument and some hand-wavy notion of body and soul.Aristotle is also known as an “realist”, and it is this treatise that I finally have come to understand what is meant by that descriptor. Instead of focussing only on the theoretical arguments for a state, Aristotle provides a quell of practical ways on how to administer justice, construct the state, manage the youth and education, and even on what type of music its citizens should enjoy. Most of these applications follow social customs at the time, and appeal to authority from Homer’s poems and the ancient gods, so I didn’t find them convincing in the slightest.

47,17,Rowland Pasaribu,"In many ways, the Politics is a companion volume to the “Nicomachean Ethics”, in which Aristotle defines a life of good quality and sets about describing how it should be achieved. The Politics, to a large extent, is an effort to describe the kind of political association that would best facilitate the ends described in the Ethics.However, the Politics is not subservient to the Ethics. Aristotle's claim is not that cities must exist to serve the ends of individuals. Rather, he claims that individuals are to a large extent defined by the cities they live in and that man can be fully human (i.e. fully rational) only by participating in the city. The city is a complete whole and each individual is a mere part. The city is thus more important than the individual.The tension between practical and speculative reasoning is central to the Politics. Practical reasoning is necessary for political and social matters, while speculative reasoning is necessary for theoretical and philosophical problems. Ultimately, Aristotle concludes in both the Ethics and the Politics that speculative reasoning is superior, as it is through a proper exercise of this faculty that man achieves true happinessWhereas Aristotle views the exercise of speculative reasoning as and end in itself, he considers the exercise of practical reasoning an integral means to this end. Because an individual cannot learn to exercise his reason properly outside the confines of the city, and because the city is able to function only as a result of man's practical reasoning, practical reasoning is thus a prerequisite for the exercise of speculative reasoning.Interestingly, Aristotle never concerns himself with questions of how much authority the state should have over the individual. A central question of modern political philosophy is the extent to which the state should be able to impose itself on the freedom of the individual. This question would not have made sense to Aristotle because he saw the goal of the city and the goal of the individual as identical. While his assertion—that the individual is only a subservient part of the state—might seem mildly totalitarian, his view was that the individual could have no truly rational needs or interests outside the confines of the state. As a result, it would be absurd to desire any kind of individual freedom in opposition to the state.""Justice"" might seem an odd term for what is essentially the right to hold more distinguished public offices. It is important to remember, however, that in a Greek city-state, serving in public office was essential to citizenship and was a high distinction. Further, those who occupied places of high distinction were more likely to enjoy other benefits as well.Aristotle's method, here and elsewhere, is largely descriptive. He conducts extensive surveys of the different forms of government and theory and his own theory is less of a creative endeavor than Plato's in the “Republic”. Rather, it is a series of recommendations based on what he has observed. None of Aristotle's practical advice is particularly novel; his insights are more a synthesis of analyses by a man who has studied politics extensively.***Though the Politics ends quite abruptly with the discussion of some minor points of interest in regard to music, there is no reason to believe that some further section of the text has been lost. The Politics was compiled as lecture notes from the courses Aristotle taught at the Lyceum and was not intended for publication. The likely explanation for this ending, then, is that it marks the end of a specific lecture, though Aristotle perhaps taught further topics in political theory at another time.Aristotle's firm stance against any kind of skill or knowledge that comes to be utilized for someone else's sake epitomizes his means-end dichotomy. Practical reasoning serves the entire city, of which each individual is a part, and speculative reasoning serves one's own happiness; each type of reasoning has its end in the self. When an individual engages in an activity whose end is to please others, such as playing music, however, that individual becomes a means for others to achieve leisure, ceasing to be an end in himself.The aristocratic amateurism that Aristotle espouses evidences his elitist conception of class differences. Citizens should look down upon musicians and other such practitioners of arts because they practice their skill for the sake of others. Aristotle considers these practitioners simply a means for citizens to the end of leisure. As such, he inherently disparages the value of art for its own sake and the importance of art as self-expression—two notions integral to the modern conception of the self. Of course, ancient Greece was very different from the modern world. Citizens felt contempt for non-citizen manual laborers because their existence had worth only in the service of others. Their skills were not ends in themselves but rather means to others' ends.Aristotle's discussion of music is difficult to understand for a number of reasons. Foremost among these is that very little is known about what Greek music actually sounded like. Historians know what instruments the Greeks played and that they based their melodies on different modal arrangements, which they felt were expressive of different states of character or emotion. Historians also know that music was very important to the Greeks: they felt that certain harmonies were divine and that music could express character and moral virtues better than any other medium. Aristotle believes that music can serve moral purposes because it can, quite literally, ""represent"" states of character just as paintings can represent trees and houses. By representing a virtuous character, music can serve as a very powerful tool for moral instruction.

It is difficult to stay true to the original text and render a smooth text that the reader today can appreciate. But it is possible! Further it was pure curiosity that led me to try reading Aristoteles‘ texts. His thinking influenced the ethical and political thinking of Europe for centuries. And this is enough reason for anyone today to go back to the roots! I cannot say that I grasp the whole spectrum of his ideas, but it is a beginning and I think it is necessary to try because he is part of our intellectual heritage and if we don’t know our past we cannot form the future!

If you are looking for foundational knowledge of politics, then this is definitely one to consider to get you started.The book explains different regimes such as democracies, oligarchies, aristocracies as well as tyrannies and mixes between them all. As well as this, there are sections on what a good citizen is, the best way for regimes to govern along with generalship/war, revolutions and familial relationships.I found this to be a very stimulating read, and throughout the book it had me thinking about life in ways I hadn't done before, both my personal life to date and also the world we live in today.

59,29,Doug,"This was more interesting than I thought it would be. Throughout Ancient Greece in the days prior to Aristotle, there were numerous city states, many of which were frequently being overthrown either with revolution or war (see the History of the Peloponnesian War or Histories). Many of these city states experimented with a wide range different types of government. In Aristotle’s politics, he analyzes them in an inquiry to find the problems that different factors beget, the chief end of government, and attempts to articulate elements of the ideal government or constitution.The work is surprisingly relevant to the on-going discussions in society today. The issue of income inequality is raised and analyzed, discussion how property should be distributed among populations. Various competing senses of justice are discussed. The nature of equality and inequality are considered, along with whether different positions on can be reconciled. He discusses the role of the middle class in a stable society (I never knew the concept of “middle class” to be this ancient). If we really want to avoid creating undue misery for people, we would do well to be familiar with Aristotle’s analysis and arguments.In the process of his analysis, Aristotle makes a wide range of references to other works, people, and events. In book 2, he has an extended critique of Socrates’ Republic.Here are a number of things that particularly struck me (references: 1/2 means book 1, chapter 2):* (1/2) “For man, when perfected, is the best of animals, but, when separated from law and justice, he is the worst of all; since armed injustice is the more dangerous, and he is equipped at birth with arms, meant to e used by intelligence and virtue, which he may use for the worst ends. Wherefore, if he have not virtue, he is the most unholy and the most savage of animals, and the most full of lust and gluttony.”* (1/2) “Justice is the bond of men in states, for the administration of justice, which is the determination of what is just, is the principle of order in political society.” (I think von Mises would disagree with this statement.)* (1/3) “Others affirm that the rule of a master over slaves is contrary to nature, and that the distinction between slave and freeman exists by law only, and not by nature; and being an interference with nature is therefore unjust.”* (2/3) “For that which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it. … everybody is more inclined to neglect the duty which he expects another to fulfill.” (This is why big cities strangle a sense of personal responsibility in the populace toward elements in the city.)* (2/5) “No one, when men have all things in common, will any longer set an example of liberality or do any liberal action; for liberality consists in the use which is made of property. Such legislation may have a specious appearance of benevolence; men readily listen to it, and are easily induced to believe that in some wonderful manner everybody will become everybody’s friend, especially when some one is heard denouncing the evils now existing in states, suits about contracts, convictions of perjury, flatteries of rich men and the like, which are said to arise out of the possession of private property. These evils, however, are due to a very different cause—the wickedness of human nature.”* (2/6) “Some, indeed, say that the best constitution is a combination of all existing forms, and they praise the Lacedaemonian because it is made up of oligarchy, monarchy, and democracy.” (Sounds reminiscent of the US Constitution and its three branches of government.)* (2/7) “…it is not the possessions but the desires of mankind which require to be equalized, and this is impossible, unless a sufficient education is provided by the laws.”* (2/7) “The fact is that the greatest crimes are caused by excess and not by necessity. Men do not become tyrants in order that they may not suffer cold;”* (2/7) “…for it is the nature of desire not to be satisfied, and most men live only for the gratification of it. The beginning of reform is not so much to equalize property as to train the noble sort of natures not to desire more, and to prevent the lower from getting more; that is to say, they must be kept down, but not ill-treated.”* (3/9) “For the one party, if they are unequal in one respect, for example wealth, consider themselves to be unequal in all; and the other party, if they are equal in one respect, for example free birth, consider themselves to be equal in all.”* (3/9) “…a state exists for the sake of a good life, and not for the sake of life only.”* (3/10) “There is also a doubt as to what is to be the supreme power in the state: Is it the multitude? Or the wealthy? Or the good? Or the one best man? Or a tyrant? Any of these alternatives seems to involve disagreeable consequences. If the poor, for example, because they are more in number, divide among themselves the property of the rick — is not this unjust? No, by heaven (will be the reply), for the supreme authority justly willed it. But if this is not injustice, pray what is? Again, when in the first division, all has been taken, and the majority divide anew the property of the minority, is it not evident, if this goes on, that they will ruin the state?”* (3/15) “We will being by inquiring whether it is more advantageous to be ruled by the best man or by the best laws. The advocates of royalty maintain that the laws speak only in general terms, and cannot provide for circumstances; and that for any science to abide by written rules is absurd. … Hence it is clear that a government acting according to written laws is plainly not the best. Yet surely the ruler cannot dispense with the general principle which exists in law… The best man, then, must legislate, and laws must be passed, but these laws will have no authority when they miss the mark, though in all other cases retaining their authority.”* (3/15) “…the many are more incorruptible than the few.” (Interesting statement that pre-dates mass media. I think that the many are putty in the hands of the few, so this principle is less true than once it was.)* (4/11) “…the poor and the rich quarrel with one another, and whichever side gets the better, instead of establishing a just or popular government, regards political supremacy as the prize of victory, and the one party sets up a democracy and the other an oligarchy.” * (5/1) “Those who excel in virtue have the best right of all to rebel … but then they are of all men the least inclined to do so.”* (5/4) “Well begun is half done.” (In my translation, he’s quoting this statement, not coining it.)* (5/8) “No ordinary man can discern the beginning of evil, but only the true statesman.”* (5/9) “If equality of property is introduced, the state must of necessity take another form; for when by laws carried to excess one or other element in the state is ruined, the constitution is ruined.”* (5/9) “But of all the things I have mentioned that which most contributes to the permanence of constitutions is the adaptation of education to the form of government, and yet in our own day this principle is universally neglected. The best laws, though sanctioned by every citizen of the sate, will be of no avail unless the young are trained by habit and education in the spirit of the constitution, if the laws are democratically, democratically, or oligarchically, if the laws are oligarchical. For there may be a want of self-discipline in states as well as individuals.”* (5/9) “Now, to have been educated in the spirit of the constitution is not to perform the actions in which oligarchs or democrats delight, but those by which the existence of an oligarchy or of a democracy is made possible. Whereas among ourselves the sons of the ruling class in an oligarchy live in luxury, but the sons of the poor are hardened by exercise and toil, and hence they are both more inclined and better able to make a revolution. And in democracies of the more extreme type there has arisen a false idea of freedom which is contradictory to the true interests of the state. For two principles are characteristic of democracy, the government of the majority and freedom. Men think that what is just is equal; and that equality is the supremacy of the popular will; and that freedom means the doing what a man likes. In such democracies every one lives as he pleases, or in the words of Euripides, ‘according to his fancy.’ But this is all wrong; men should not think it slavery to live according to the rule of the constitution; for it is their salvation.”* (5/10) “History shows that almost all tyrants have been demagogues who gained the favor of the people by their accusation of the notables.”* (6/4) “Every man should be responsible to others, nor should any one be allowed to do just as he pleases; for where absolute freedom is allowed there is nothing to restrain the evil which is inherent in every man.” (A strong argument against von Mises position in Liberalism)* (7/7) “But the Hellenic race … if it could be formed into one state, would be able to rule the world.” (Fascinating statement made by the tutor of Alexander the Great, who tried to do just this.)* (7/8) “a state is not a community of living beings only, but a community of equals, aiming at the best life possible. Now, whereas happiness is the highest good, being a realization and perfect practice of virtue, which some can attain, while others have little or none of it.”* (7/13) “This makes men fancy that external goods are the cause of happiness, yet we might as well say that a brilliant performance on the lyre was to be attributed to the instrument and not to the skill of the performer.”* (7/14) “…he who would learn to command well must, as men say, first of all learn to obey.”* (8/3) “To be always seeking after the useful does not become free and exalted souls.”

60,0,Domhnall,"In about 350 BC Europe was about to embark on an era of civilisation for which Aristotle wrote the users manual. When his student, Alexander the Great, conquered a huge territory from Turkey to Afghanistan, Hellenic philosophy sparked changes including the transformation of Judaism from a primitive to a more sophisticated type of religion. It is not surprising to find similarities there and in the writings of St Paul to the views first articulated by Aristotle nor – in a pleasing symmetry - that medieval popes thought Aristotle must have been divinely inspired to anticipate so much of their own beliefs. Renaissance and early modern political theory owed everything to the rediscovery of the Greeks and not least Aristotle, and it is not hard to recognise his Politics recycled through Locke’s Treatises on Government or the constitution of the United States. In debates with modern Americans, the habitual insistence on appealing to first principles and to Natural Law, subordinating many human rights to property rights, and women to men, are all familiar territory to readers of Aristotle. I suspect there are many different and valid ways to read Aristotle’s Politics but to understand European political history it is absolutely essential to be aware of it. Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics concludes in the view that a life of virtue requires “right laws” and hence we need to examine how such legislation can be accomplished. “But it is difficult to get from youth up a right training for virtue if one has not been brought up under right laws; for to live temperately and hardily is not pleasant to most people, especially when they are young. … This is why some think that legislators ought to stimulate men to virtue and urge them forward by the motive of the noble, on the assumption that those who have been well advanced by the formation of habits will attend to such influences; and that punishments and penalties should be imposed on those who disobey and are of inferior nature, while the incurably bad should be completely banished. … the man who is good must be well trained and habituated, and go on to spend his time in worthy occupations and neither willingly nor unwillingly do bad actions, and this can be brought about if men live in accordance with a sort of reason, and right order, provided this has force… It would seem from what has been said that he can do this better if he makes himself capable of legislating. For public control is plainly effected by laws, and good control by good laws…”  [N Ethics Book X Ch 9] The Politics itself opens with a firm assertion of the centrality of politics: “Every state is a community of some kind and every community is established with a view to some good; for mankind always act in order to obtain that which they think good. But, if all communities aim at some good, the state or political community, which is the highest of all, and which embraces all the rest, aims at good in a greater degree than any other, and at the highest good.” [Bk 1, Ch 1] In Book 1, Aristotle constructs his vision of the political community from simple elements which, to his mind, are a necessary state of affairs. “In the first place there must be a union of those who cannot exist without each other; namely, of male and female, that the race may continue (…because, in common with other animals and with plants, mankind have a natural desire to leave behind them an image of themselves), and of natural ruler and subject, that both may be preserved… Out of these two relationships between man and woman, master and slave, the first thing to arise is the family. The family is the association established by nature for the supply of men’s everyday wants, … But when several families are united, and the association aims at something more than the supply of daily needs, the first society to be formed is the village… When several villages are united in a single complete community, large enough to be nearly of quite self-sufficing, the state comes into existence, originating in the bare needs of life and continuing in existence for the sake of the good life. “Hence it is evidence that the state is a creation of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal. And he who by nature and not by mere accident is without a state is either a bad man or above humanity; he is like the < tribeless, lawless, hearthless one> whom Homer denounces – the natural outcast is fortwith a lover of war… Now that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other gregarious animal is evident. Nature as we often say, makes nothing in vain, and man is the only animal whom she has endowed with the gift of speech. And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure of pain, and is therefore found in other animals… the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and the inexpedient, and likewise the just and the unjust. And it is a characteristic of man that he alone has any sense of good and evil, of just and unjust and the like, and the association of living beings who have this sense makes a family and a state.” [Bk 1 Ch 2]. “…the first and fewest possible parts of a family are master and slave, husband and wife, father and children.” [Bk 1 Ch 3] “…Property is a part of the household and the art of acquiring property is part of the art of managing the household; for no man can live well, or indeed live at all, unless he be provided with the necessaries… a possession is an instrument for maintaining life. And so, in the arrangement of the family, a slave is a living possession, and property a number of such instruments. … he who is by nature not his own but another’s man, is by nature a slave, and he may be said to be another’s man who, being a human being, is also a possession.” [Bk1 Ch 4]“For that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.” [Bk 1 Ch 5]""It is clear that the rule of the soul over the body and of the mind and the rational element over the passionate, is natural and expedient, whereas the equality of the two or the rule of the inferior is always hurtful. The same holds good of animals in relation to men; for tame animals have a better nature than wild, and all tame animals are better off when they are ruled by man, for then they are preserved. Again, the male is by nature superior, and the female inferior; and the one rules, the other is ruled; this principle, of necessity, extends to all mankind…” [Bk1 ch 5]Book II sets out to consider the broad principles of the distribution of political power and material wealth. After criticising Plato’s two ideal states, The Republic and The Laws, and then the theories of Hippodamus, it discusses the constitutions of a range of states – Lacedaemonian (Sparta), Cretan, Carthaginian – and identifies their limitations. Book III asks “who is the citizen and what is the meaning of the term.” He suggests “He who has the power to take part in the deliberative or judicial administration of any state is said to be a citizen of that state and, speaking generally, a state is a body of citizens sufficient for the purposes of life.” [Bk III Ch 1]. Aristotle acknowledges diverse constitutional arrangements are possible, and suggests that there are true forms and perversions: “The words constitution and government have the same meaning and the government, which is the supreme authority in states, must be in the hands of one, or of a few, or of the many. The true forms of government, therefore, are those in which the one, the few or the many govern with a view to the common interest; the governments which rule with a view to the private interest, whether of the one, or of the few, or of the many, are perversions.” [Bk III Ch 7]. There follows an elaborate discussion of the claims made for different forms of rule. Book IV questions what kind of government is best adapted to a particular state, with a warning that “political writers, although they have excellent ideas, are often impractical…. Any change of government which has to be introduced should be one which men, starting from their existing constitutions, will be both willing and able to adopt, since there is quite as much trouble in the reformation of an old constitution as in the establishment of a new one, just as to unlearn is has hard as to learn. … We must know the varieties and the number of varieties of each form of government, if only with a view to making laws. For the same laws cannot be equally suited to all oligarchies or to all democracies, since there is certainly more than one form both of democracy and of oligarchy.” [Bk IV Ch 1] He warns, too, of the risks in any form of government. E.g. “For in democracies that are subject to the law, the best citizens hold the first place, and there are no demagogues; but where the laws are not supreme, there demagogues spring up… At any event, this sort of democracy, which is now a monarch, and no longer under the control of law, seeks to exercise monarchical sway, and grows into a despot; the flatterer is held in honour, this sort of democracy being relative to other democracies what tyranny is to other forms of monarchy.” [Bk IV Ch 4]. He later advocates “Thus it is manifest that the best political community is formed by citizens of the middle-class, and that those states are likely to be well administered, and stronger if possible than both the other classes, or at any rate then either singly; for the addition of the middle class turns the scale, and prevents either of the extremes from being dominant…” [Bk IV Ch 11] and in chapter 12 he describes techniques by which both oligarchies and democracies set out to deceive the people. Book V looks into circumstances leading to revolution against the government of a state. He suggests that “Revolutions in democracies are generally caused by the intemperance of the magistrates.” They arise in oligarchies when the people are oppressed or when there is a quarrel among the oligarchs. They arise in aristocracies “when the mass of the people are of the high spirited kind and have a notion they are as good as their rulers.” He later considers the same for monarchy and tyranny. Useful cautions are these: “Again, the revolution may be accomplished by small degrees; I mean that a great change may sometimes slip into the constitution through neglect of a small matter...” “The citizens begin by giving up some part of the constitution, and so with greater ease the government change something else which is a little more important, until they have undermined the whole fabric of the state.”Book VI looks into various forms of government. He suggests that “democracy and demos in their truest forms are based upon recognized principles of democratic justice, that all should count equally.”  [Bk VI Ch 2]. “The first and best attempered of oligarchies is akin to a constitutional government.” [Ch 5]. Book VII argues that “the form of government is best in which every man, whoever he is, can act best and live happily.""  The choices discussed – such as the ideal population size – suggest the this is largely relevant to the ancient world in which the Greeks established new colonies all around the Mediterranean. Book VIII examines the education of citizens. “Since the whole city has one end, it is manifest that education should be one and the same for all, and that it should be public and not private - … Neither must we suppose that any one of the citizens belongs to himself; for they all belong to the state and are each of them a part of the state and the care of each part is inseparable from the care of the whole. … That education should be regulated by law and should be an affair of the state is not to be denied… [but] mankind are by no means agreed about the things to be taught….” [Book VIII Ch 1,2]

62,2,Borum,"This is my first time at reading Aristotle, and I thought I was ready after being trained by Plato's dialogues. Boy was I mistaken. I also made the error of not reading the Nichomachean Ethics before reading the Politics. It might not have mattered, but I'm considering reading the Politics again after I read the Ethics to get a better grasp at Aristotle's idea of political virtue and the difference between the virtue of man and the virtue of a citizen.Aristotle and Plato is like the two sides of a coin, and I'm planning on reading a book called The Cave and the Light: Plato Versus Aristotle, and the Struggle for the Soul of Western Civilization after reading their works. It's fascinating how the teacher and the student can differ so much on basically the same issue. They are both preoccupied with how we can make men happier and thus are always questioning the main way for man to become happy, i.e. the virtue of man and man's society. I'm glad I read this after reading Plato's Republic, as I had some questions and objections regarding Plato's idealized and probably improbable republic with a tinge of totalitarianism. Aristotle criticizes Plato's Republic and some of his other works and even goes on to point out the faults of the other actual regimes in the vicinity. However, I'm still left with the question: so, what's the alternative, then?This is an important question, because unlike Plato, Aristotle doesn't linger on the discussion of 'what' virtue is, but moves on the main question of 'how' to attain that virtue and whether the ideal virtue is actually attainable or feasible in the given circumstances. This is reflected in his classification of the different sort of economic and educational activities and his search for the not only the 'best' regime and legislation in the unqualified sense, but also the 'best' regime and legislation according to the different cities. However, he keeps reminding us that all these economic, educational and administrative and adjudicative activities and systems are just the 'means' to achieve the real 'end (telos)' Man is a political animal that intentionally establish political communities not just for self-sustenance but also for the pleasure of living together and the virtue of a noble life. Insomuch as money is just the means and currency used in economic activities and should not become its aim, all the regime and legislation and the components and systems of a city are the means to achieve that political virtue. Even the people should not forget that their wealth, birth or number are just circumstantial merits in becoming full citizens and remain the mere tools of political power play and actively participate in order to achieve their true common goal. The first reading left me feeling a little alienated (disgusted, to be honest) by Aristotle's blatant stance to denigrate anyone who is not a citizen of Athens (including women, slaves and foreigners) but I tried to get over that by reminding myself not to judge him on my own anachronistic point of view. Then I got put off by his opposition to democracy but I later learned his distinction between democracy and polity and also learned of the demagoguery in the years during and after the Peloponnesian War. I'm still a little disappointed in his conservative tendency to stick to the status quo, but after having got over with it, I'm finding interesting and even quite astute points being made throughout the book. I'm only sorry that the book is not fully restored. Books 6 and 8 are inconclusive and some pages seemed to have become either physically lost in antiquity or lost in translation. I'm hoping that reading other works by Aristotle (Nichomachean Ethics, Metaphysics) will give me a more complete picture.

64,4,Alan Johnson,"(Note: The Goodreads description of this second edition of the Carnes Lord translation is in a language other than English. However, the ASIN [Kindle] and ISBN [paperback] numbers refer to Carnes Lord's English translation, which is the subject of the following review.)I initially read Sir Ernest Barker's translation of Aristotle's Politics in 1965. The present edition by Carnes Lord includes an excellent translation and introduction with helpful endnotes regarding the meaning of important Greek terms, relevant ancient history, alternative translations, and variations in the manuscript sources. As for Aristotle's work itself, one finds many objectionable things (slavery, the inferior role of women typical of ancient Athenian society, the also typical incorporation of the religious priesthood into the government of the polis, the limitations of citizenship, and so forth) as well as some important insights. Ever the empiricist, Aristotle discusses at great length the many varieties of government that the Greeks and others had created during and before his era. All in all, it is quite a puzzling picture for us denizens of the twenty-first century. At some point, I may do a more exhaustive critique of the Politics, but other scholarly projects preoccupy me at the moment. The five-star rating is for the editorial and translation work of the subject edition. It is impossible to rate Aristotle himself, but the fact that his work has survived for more than two millennia is itself an indication that we can still learn from him, even while disagreeing with some of his apparent teachings. In this connection, no less a democrat than Thomas Jefferson wrote, with regard to the Declaration of Independence (which he substantially authored), that ""[a]ll its authority rests then on the harmonizing sentiments of the day, whether expressed in conversation, in letters, printed essays, or in the elementary books of public right, as Aristotle, Cicero, Locke, Sidney, &c."" Thomas Jefferson to Henry Lee, May 8, 1825, in Thomas Jefferson: Writings, ed. Merrill D. Peterson (New York: Library of America, 1984), 1501. Many historians and political scientists also attribute certain aspects of the U.S. Constitution (especially the mixed nature of the republican framework) to Aristotle's Politics. Aristotle is not the last word, but his contribution to political philosophy should not be ignored.

65,5,C.P.,"What is remarkable is how little has changed in the conservative and liberal positions since Aristotle. Some of it reads like it came from a recent blog.My interest in finishing reading this classic is to provide some context for my discussion of the polis and the oikos in the second and, hopefully soon, first published edition of my book ""Popular Capitalism"". The treatment of the oikos was superficial and none of analysis applied to the polis was used in a deeper analysis of the oikos. Federation and empire were also treated superficially as the polis writ large. The political analysis, or what passes for it today, of the liberal and conservative adopt the same superficiality resulting in their error of making no distinctions between the levels of government, nor between individuals, families, households and corporations as ""private"" entities.On the other hand, Aristotle's analysis of education as a preparation for one's role in the polis is accurate and, though limited to the single role of citizenship and omitting the crucial mechanism of the examination, is an excellent basis for an analysis encompassing the merit examinations for civil service advocated by Carl Schurz, academia and vocational training.Most of the book is devoted to the study of constitutions and directed toward goals from his book on Ethics with the emphasis of the Socratic school on seeking the morally ""good"" or ""best"" of everything. Though I find no merit in morality, I can see where this study could afford an excellent introduction to comparative political science, including the effect of philosophical bias on those studies.

66,6,E.H. Nolan,"First, read Plato’s Republic. Then you can read Aristotle. It’s only fair, since he was Plato’s student and protégé. If you’re not used to political writings, especially ancient ones, this might seem a little daunting, but trust me, you’ll get through it. You can look at it with irony, sadness, or happiness at human relativity, but the truth is politics hasn’t changed that much through the centuries. Entire college courses have been devoted to studying Aristotle’s philosophies, and we’re still not any closer to finding the meaning of life than he was!In Politics, Aristotle asks questions about the individual’s role in society. How should one conduct himself in order to be useful to the state and to his fellow citizens? He delves into the nature of an ideal society, much like his teacher Plato did in The Republic.  Those who have already studied Plato will see the student, clearly admiring his mentor but wanting to contribute his own theories to the same questions, and that in itself makes it a fascinating read.If you’re interested in studied the Founding Fathers of philosophy and “the ideal society”, Plato and Aristotle are must-reads. Just take it slow and don’t get overwhelmed by the structure. (But don’t worry if you get overwhelmed and take a long time to get through it. I was a political science student and got overwhelmed myself!) Just remember that he’s just like you: wondering, unsure, and hopeful.http://hottoastyrag.weebly.com/politi...

67,7,Browne,"My initial review for this was getting to around 2000 words which is the longest continuous piece of writing I've done since uni (life has been very undemanding since then) so clearly this book fulfils the criteria of being thought provoking. I'll dump that vomit in an anonymous blog or something.Aristotle is alien to the modern Western spirit of politics. His ideal state features slaves, extremely limited if not absent democracy, a rejection of the idea of 'the dignity of labour' especially for the ruling classes (see this excellent essay on the matter by Nietzsche: ""The Greek State"" http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche...), a disdain for money and international trade (""[states] should not become marketplaces for the world"" how anathema is this to the values which politicians and entrepreneurs now espouse?), and a strict hierarchy, amongst other things.These ideas ought to be dealt with seriously and not merely cast off because they bump up against the moral truisms of our age, maybe you find yourself agreeing with Aristotle on these points? He certainly argues logically, as you would expect, equally there are good arguments you could raise against him.Besides all this, the book serves as a cool glance at the various constitutions of the Ancient Greek world.

68,8,Bryan,"The irony of me calling Aristotle's work average is not lost on me.: Yep, I feel way over my head giving Aristotle three stars, but I'm throwing in my two cents anyhow.  This book is an incredible window into another time. Aristotle's views on a number of topics (women and slavery come quickly to mind) stand out so opposed to our beliefs today that it's almost worth reading this book just to get some perspective on how new some of the social ideas we take for granted really are. Getting that sense of perspective is truly the best part of this book.  That said, there is little here beyond that for anyone but a student of philosophy or someone engaging in a very serious study of the history of government. Very little of what Aristotle says rings true today and at times it's as if he went to the future and decided to predict the exact opposite of what's come to pass.  If you are a layperson looking for a classic on government, I recommend Plato's Republic. While it is even older than Aristotle's work, it is filled with insights that feel as if they must have been written in modern times. That is a truly inspiring feat of thought and foresight.

Who are it's citizens, who are not citizens, what kinds of governments are there, why some should be considered better than others, and how the people are raised, educated, and participate in their government.I liked this better than I liked ""The Republic"", maybe because this deals more with solid principles where ""The Republic"" was looking to define a more abstract principle. However, I fell both books are extremely relevant today, maybe ""Politics"" more so given it's subject matter.I do feel I need to read ""Nicomachean Ethics"" as it's the other side of the coin to ""Politics"" and maybe it'll give a better look at Aristotle's bigger picture.

Because Aristotle firmly believed that ethics and politics are closely linked.

85,25,GUILLAUME ATTIA,"That ‘Man is a political animal’ is unquestionably Aristotle’s most popular saying. It is generally taken to mean that what makes us human, or at least separates us from animals, is the observable fact that we engage in political activity. This unique human trait is of course an entailment of our rationality. So understood, Aristotle’s celebrated words may seem unimaginative. It does not appear in hindsight that one needs the brainpower of a genius to appreciate the resonance of this simple observation. However, when one places those famous words in their proper context, as part of Aristotle’s inquiry into the role of community in human life, one soon recognizes not only the profundity of so simple an observation but also the sophisticated intellect needed to make it. Aristotle was indeed a profound thinker and the Politics is a reflection of that. Hence when Aristotle says that “man is a political animal” (p.10), for example, he is not simply stating the obvious fact that human beings engage in politics. His deeper, and more radical, point is that it is only in the polis or city that human beings can truly prosper and flourish. It is in the city that human beings fulfill the potentialities of their nature. How does the city enable humans to achieve their full potential? The community provides the structure through which humans are able to use their God-given reason and language to philosophize with other human beings in order to partner in the creation of a just community. As he explains it, “language serves to declare what is advantageous and what is reverse” (p.11) but also to deliberate about good and evil, justice and injustice, and many other concepts that need to be understood and agreed upon by members of a community in order to establish a good society. The importance of language for political organization, particularly the establishment of a sound constitution, was not taken for granted by the social contract theorists of the 17th century and beyond. The great John Rawls (1921 – 2002), for example, saw it as a foundational precondition of good governance that citizens have a serious discussion among themselves about which theory of justice should permeate their political decisions. Such compacts would not be possible without the capacity for reasoned discourse. Aristotle argues that it is this capacity for rational discussion, and no other, which “is the peculiarity of man, in comparison with other animals” (p.11). It is language therefore, or more precisely rationality, rather than a capacity to be political, that is the distinguishing feature of humanity. Thus contrary to popular belief, Aristotle did not in fact believe that humans were the only political animals. This can plainly be seen in the text when he specifies a few lines after declaring that ‘man is a political animal’ that he is so “in a higher degree than bees or other gregarious animals” (p.10). In his History of Animals, Aristotle observes that ants and bees are ‘political’ in the sense that they work together for a common goal or purpose (487b33 – 488a12). While humans do the same, “man alone of the animals is furnished with the faculty of language” (p.11). That is what makes him unique. That being said, humanity’s rational capacity is not accidental. “Nature”, Aristotle explains, “makes nothing in vain” (p.10): nature, or nature’s god, intended for language to be a gateway for communal living. The city therefore is a natural institution. The city not only exists by nature but is “prior in the order of nature to the family and the individual” (p.11). Not only is the city a natural institution but also by extension, city living itself is a natural state of being for human beings. It thus follows that it is simply unnatural for man, on Aristotle’s view, to live a life outside of the polis. Such a man, “the man who is isolated, who is unable to share in the benefits of political association, or has no need to share because he is already self-sufficient, is no part of the city, and must therefore be either a beast or a god” (p.11). This view of civilized existence as being inextricably bound to the communal life of the city was deeply influential in shaping Western perceptions of certain nomadic native Indian tribes. As Anthony Pagden relates in ""The Fall of Man"" (1982), for Spanish Conquistadors and British colonists of the Americas migratory groups could not ""create cities nor any form of civil association for the simple reason that civil association depends upon temporal continuity, upon the creation of a social space with its appropriate social and religious institutions and the cultural forms which accompany them. If, indeed, the civil life is to be largely defined as a life lived in cities, then it is obvious that people who live in tents, who are pastoralists or even hunter-gatherers rather than agriculturists, will be unable to develop a true community. Nomadism was consequently held to be inimical to every aspect of civilised life” (Pagden, 1982: 195).

86,26,Jacob Aitken,"I'll put my cards on the table.  I actively dislike Greek philosophy.  I will be fair and admit that Aristotle is a fairly good communicator, and despite his worldview, he stumbles across the truth every now and then.  And while he never really gets to a coherent statement on justice, he's important to read on that point.  Given that many ""woke"" evangelicals are talking about social justice (but never defining it), Aristotle is at least a starting point.(1) Every community is established with an aim to some good.Aristotle begins with the most basic social unit and moves outward (family, village, city).1.1 If the family is natural, and the movements outward are natural, then the state is a natural unity.The Art of Getting WealthLegitimate economics: managing a household“Retail trade is not a natural part of the art of getting wealth” (1.9.17).  This is important and will doom his entire project.Usury: makes a gain out of money itself.  The proper use of money is exchange, not to grow money from money.I used to hold to that argument. I'm not so sure anymore. It only works if we view value as something objective.  But value is anything but objective.  The whole point of an exchange is that we don't place equal value on the object.What is a state? Who is the citizen?  He notes that a citizen under one government might not be one under another. For the sake of argument he will assume democracy.  A citizen is the holder of a definite office, who legislates and judges, etc. (Book 3 ch. 1). A citizen shares in rulership. This is actually a pretty good definition, though it works better on smaller levels.The chief end of a state is the well-being of the citizensJustice: implies a relation to persons as well as things; a just distribution (Book 3; chapter 9).  He realizes this discussion is inadequate 9 pages later: “equality or inequality of what?” He hints that what is “just” or equal will be to the advantage of the common good.Book 4His famous discussion of monarchy, oligarchy, and democracy.  And their perversions. He defines democracy as the form of govt where the free are rulers (IV.4).  He comes to a surprising and welcome conclusion: the best society is the one with a large middle class.  This comes very close to a biblical worldview. It is not a biblical worldview, however, for Aristotle despises things like retail trade.  But a society with a large middle class is one that understands the value of time, risk, and planning. In other words, it presupposes the doctrine of providence.  Aristotle, however, doesn’t really get this, nor could he.This is why we should not go to Aristotle for economic wisdom.  For the godly man, time is not evil.  It is limited and under the curse, but it also provides the conditions for planning for the future and building wealth.Book VIIThis book begins on a chilling note: what are the most eligible forms of life?  This sounds a lot like the death camps we would have seen under the worst acts of the Affordable Care Act.  This is also good Greek philosophy.Before we examine why Aristotle thought it was good to kill some of the babies, we need to see why he said it.  He didn’t believe an overly-populated city was a good thing. That’s a half-truth. Many large cities today aren’t very nice places.  He probably couldn’t see past the city-state idea. You can have many people in a country if you have lots of smaller cities. That’s one example.With this background, his following comments, while evil, cohere with his system.  This is his argument:(1) To the size of states there is a limit (1326a 35).(2) The legislator must mold to his will the frames of newly-born children (1335a 5)(3) As to the exposure and rearing of children, let there be a law that no deformed child shall live, but that on the ground of an excess in the number of children, if the established customs of this state forbid this (for in our state population has a limit), no child is to be exposed, but when couples have children in excess, let abortion be procured before sense and life have begun (1335b 20-25).Is it really necessary to refute this?  Where to start? I’ll leave with an observation: given Aristotle’s anti-market views, his state population would always be extremely limited. That made abortion a pressing reality.  Therefore, his bad economics upheld his pro-choice mentality.

87,27,Fraser Kinnear,"Two pages into this book, Aristotle drops this turd:But is there any one thus intended by nature to be a slave, and for whom such a condition is expedient and right, or rather is not all slavery a violation of nature? There is no difficulty in answering this question, on grounds both of reason and of fact. For that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for ruleYikes. I remember MacIntyre grimacing over Aristotle’s position on slavery in his book “After Virtue”, which is trying to take the best of Aristotle’s ethical philosophy (orient your morals around the teleology of the subject) while brushing aside some of Aristotle’s worst conclusions (e.g., slavery).But can you? Aristotle’s opening salvo in his Politics evidence that the two are hopelessly intertwined: teleology just shifts the argument from deciding on what is moral to deciding on what something’s purpose is. And if you get the purpose of something wrong (e.g, the natural function of some people is to be slaves), then you end up with a bad value (slavery is OK).I laughed when Aristotle went from suggesting his own crazy ideas (slavery is natural, women are not equal to men, finance is evil) to pointing out how nuts Plato’s own ideas were in his “Republic” (they were!). Further, Aristotle’s reputation for thorough categorization frequently comes across as pedantic (e.g.,. “The members of a state must either have all things or nothing in common, or somethings in common and some not”). Perhaps my problem with the book was that half of the points he was making were so universally agreed upon today as to be benign, so all that’s left is to notice the howlers. I suppose this is just a reflection of his enormous influence – that his ideas are now so commonly held as to be rendered uninteresting.This book was actually much more interesting as a historical document. For example, Aristotle has some interesting proto ideas that lead towards today’s understanding of the Rule of Law: “… laws, when good, should be supreme; and that the magistrate or magistrates should regulate those maters only on which the laws are unable to speak with precision owing to the difficulty of any general principle embracing all particulars.” And elsewhere “… those who have any complaint to bring against the magistrates say, ‘let the people be judges’; the people are happy to accept the invitation; and so the authority of every office is undermined. Such a democracy is fairly open to the objection that it is not a constitution at all; for where the laws have no authority, there is no constitution. The law ought to be supreme over all, and the magistracies should judge the particulars, and only this should be considered a constitution. Embedded in the latter quote is a value judgment about democracy that needs some unpacking. Aristotle defines democracy as the negative manifestation of governments ruling in the interest of the needy majority, sometimes controlled by a demagogue, while constitutional governments are the same but with more balance towards a common good. Characterizing these various forms of government (kingship/tyranny, aristocracy/oligarchy, constitutional government / democracy) takes up the majority of the book.Another example is finding passages that I suspect were also read and underlined by America’s founding fathers, such as:…democracy and demos in their truest form are based upon the recognized principle of democratic justice, that all should count equally; for equality implies that the poor should have no more share in the government than the rich, and should not only be rulers, but that all should rule equally according to their numbers.This was an idea hotly debated, for example, during the Three-Fifths Compromise.One final example, I’m reading Hobbes’s “Leviathan” in parallel, and was excited to come across a passage that he referenced directly:The fact is, that the greatest crimes are caused by excess and not by necessity. Men do not become tyrants in order that they may not suffer cold; and hence great is the honor bestowed, not on him who kills a thief, but on him who kills a tyrant.

88,28,Ian Caveny,"Back in June, I started Aristotle's famous discourse on politics, but it was either not the right time or the right season. I couldn't quite get into the swing of thingsSo, when I approached the text again in early October of this year, I thought I may be getting myself again into the hot water of ""books that are going to take more time out of me than I'd like them to."" I was gladly reproved. I don't know what constitutes the ""appropriate reading season"" for the Politics, but for me it was entering into full-time pastoral ministry that has most helped me to finally read a classic of the art of governance. One might ask ""Why this combination?"" and to that I would respond: ""There seems to be a significant relationship between the efficient organization of the city (polis) in Aristotle's work and the efficient organization of the polity of the local Church."" Indeed, the strange similarities between Aristotle's critical-exegetical insights of the functioning of the City and the role of a pastor who ought to critically-exegete the functions of the local Church has fueled much of my reading this fall and served as a practical outlet for the knowledge gained in this reading. (I even wrote an essay for some of these practical responses to Aristotle: here.)Aristotle is a fun ancient Greek to read. I really do mean this. Sometimes right after a brilliant breakdown of political structures he will toss up some analysis of how to keep one's slaves happy, or the place of the woman in the home, or why the Phrygian mode is less educational than the Dorian mode, and you, the modern reader, just has to laugh. Maybe Aristotle gives us a sense of humility: come two thousand plus years, our thoughts too will both inspire and humor our fourth millennia audiences.The Politics is rightly understood to be a foundational text for understanding politics (of course), governance, and the like. There's a sense, as I read the Politics, that our American political world could be far-simplified if simply every senator and representative were required to read Aristotle prior to his or her oath of office. It would have the power to re-frame debate and discourse; we could see our two-party system as a balance between those who pretend to be oligarchs and those who pretend to be democrats (and who, in reality, are both both of those things). Moreover, it would remind us that all good cities, in order to prosper, must target themselves at a good end (telos).There are many other reasons to read the Politics, but they can all be summed up, perhaps, in one sentence: This argument is the foundational undergirding of most of the greatest arguments of the history of Western civilization. Without the Politics there is, in theology, no City of God and, thus, no Two Kingdoms; without the Politics there is, in philosophy, no Hegelian dialectic (founded upon the master-bondsman discourse early in the text) and, thus, no Marxist dialectic (founded upon the first half of the book); without the Politics there is, in history and politics, no American Constitution. Thus, it is so surprising that I am so late in my education to read even just a part of it. It seems to me that all these above texts are, for better and for worse, incomprehensible without reading their sourcetext. It would be like reading Paul's Letter to the Romans apart from the Book of Genesis. The context is crucial.As such, I heartily endorse the reading of Aristotle. He is a good antidote to the idealistic temperaments of our age, even if he, at times, makes one laugh at his idiosyncrasies. At the end of the day, his core arguments - about telos and about the polis - are the foundations of most of our academic and day-to-day thought, and we would be fools not to seek understanding of our own foundations.

89,29,Lanko,"There's so much to say about this book that would take probably many hours to properly do it. Maybe I will do it later.As for the book, it's both inspiring and depressing. Inspiring in the sense that there's someone who experimented and knows about issues that even today and were debated and studied since his time. Depressing in the sense that when you read his words on everything that can go wrong on a government we actually realize more than 2500 years later we as humans didn't actually changed at all (Aristotle was born in 384 B.C and also gives examples of decades/centuries before).He may place too much emphasis on the State, but considering his time, it's not surprising. Populations were really small, continents had vast amounts of empty areas, harsh conditions and sickness. No wonder he placed so much value on the State to bring people together.But he also didn't exactly forget about individualism. One of the most curious chapters is when he discusses Plato's Republic, an idea of Socrates of so much coletivism that even wives and children would be shared among everyone.To think that Aristotle actually had to work years to actually seriously write a whole chapter to totally refute this Socrates' concept of State (and that the idea was even conceived and taken seriously in the first place) seems laughable.But then we look what all sides on the political spectrum pretty much in every country are actually discussing...Aristotle has views on slavery that of course wouldn't be accepted today. But more than 2000 years after his writings we still needed major wars to decide if slavery was legal or not, things like Apartheid and even today slavery exists in some corners of the Earth. Aristotle has views on women being mostly passive in society. Same thing. We have entire countries that do much worse to them and our elected leaders turn a blind eye if they a convenient economic treaty.Aristotle disdains the manual worker. But does our society views them that differently today?When those passages appeared and I thought ""Well, today is different, this is from your time"", a few seconds later those considerations popped in. So do we, overall as a society really can claim the moral ground to criticize the man when even leaders elected by ourselves turn a blind eye to the problems above?This makes one feel small when considering the vast amount of time that passed from his age to ours. Yes, we had changes, but little changed in the essence of things.He also makes some mistakes. For example, he says that the people, when grouped, is less susceptible to demagogy and its dangers. Maybe it was true in his time, where cities and countries were really small and you knew pretty much everyone in it. You saw those people every day and thus could see daily their true behavior and make a judgement of it if they decided to do a public political speech and had to do it in front of everyone.The vastness countries assumed today would certainly astound Aristotle. All we know from people wanting power is really what THEY want us to know and what their ENEMIES wants us to know, both with possibilities of being lies. Add to that PR, TV, radio, etc.Anyway, it's pretty clear that vast crowds are exactly where people get too emotional and less rational, without a doubt. That's how the worst demagogues came and still come to power. In vast crowds the individual easily becomes a sheep.There's also a chapter on how monarchs fall. Machiavelli talked about hate and disdain for the ruler and whether to be feared and loved and examples. He needed a whole book for that. Aristotle did it in a single chapter. Almost 2000 years before too.I think it's enough. No wonder the man was/is one of the most influential people of all time.

90,0,Scott Holstad,"Doesn't live up to his reputation. But then, many feel he himself didn't live up to his reputation (nor Plato). I believe many scholars have determined Democritus (with Leucippus) to be far more influential, accurate, knowledgeable, possibly more intelligent (certainly than Plato) and diverse, among other things. Noted virtually universally as ""father of modern science,"" through Leucippus's influence, he is often thought to be the first physicist, as he is typically credited for his formulation of an (detailed) atomic theory for the universe. In fact, his atomic hypothesis was developed to such a degree, and unlike anything else at the time, bore a resemblance to modern science and one could essentially argue that what we know, or learned, about atomics in the twentieth century was directly influenced by Democritus' atomic theory, which in many ways remains the basis for current atomic physics. Moreover, he dabbled and proved influential in a number of other areas, ranging from geometry specifically and math in general to geography and anthropology to the importance and essence of epistemology to scientific aesthetics to politics and natural philosophy (of course), where he seemed especially concerned with the subject of ethics, to military tactics as well as cosmology, poetry, biology and many, many more subjects -- really the first true Renaissance man. Really kind of puts some better known philosophers to shame (not that some weren't also geniuses -- it's just that many people can't find many in history, and virtually none before Democritus to explore and master such a wide variety of subjects. Indeed, his ""void"" thesis lived on to influence Newton and continued to hold that influence basically until Einstein). However, regarding this book by Aristotle, while this was a subject he was well versed in and despite this book being a bit dated, it was still fairly well done for the times, had some good ideas, thoughts, points, etc. Unfortunately, there's always been some controversy surrounding it due to some textual irregularities and discrepancies in some of the eight ""books"" making up this book, or rather what remains of them. (Some of the major topics among these different books include ideas about community, citizenship, regimes, education, constitutions and political theory, among others.) However, this to the point that some have argued the book represents seemingly two different versions, or perhaps stages, in Aristotle's thoughts, beliefs, positions, etc., and the two opposing sides seem so varied, almost oppositional, that IF Aristotle even wrote the entire thing himself, it's likely he would have done so over a long period of time, so that a significant period of time elapsed between the first and later sections, thus explaining its inconsistencies and, one might say, possibly two different belief systems. Thus, I'm only giving it two stars because even though it might otherwise merit three at least, the problems noted make it difficult to have confidence regarding sufficient authenticity, consistency and more, and frankly results in a poor book in its known form and hence one of his lesser works. As a result, not recommended.

91,1,Brandon,"This book gave me a lot to think about and I would like to return to it after reading Plato's Republic, since a lot of it hinges on a criticism of that book. One thing I did not expect was that there is a lot of history and description of actual regimes in this book. There were many anecdotes from Greek politics, many interesting and some even amusing, but the historical section of the book got somewhat tedious because I was looking more for his theory of government. It's not until the last two chapters where Aristotle says what he thinks it the best type of government, and I found this part to be the most interesting. The entire last chapter is about education, and much of it about music education. I get the impression that Aristotle liked music.Much is made of how slavery is so central to Aristotle's argument. If one considers our modern equivalent of slave labor is automation and robotics, then those who would view politics as mere ""social engineering"" - perhaps you may call them technocrats - in a way are trying to simplify politics into mastery. To Aristotle this is unacceptable, because proper rule is between equals. In this understanding, his contention that proper rule is not an extrapolation of mastery is still applicable to today even though we find human slavery deplorable. One thing I disagreed with him on was that people who are capable of self-rule need to have an abundance in leisure. In fact, while in describing the nature of regimes he states that democracy works best when it is made up of farmers, because they have their own business to attend to and only make laws that are really needed. But in the section on his ideal regime, he says that ideally all the farming is done by slaves, so that the ruling class can have idle leisure. I think this is very similar to our current historical situation in the developed world, where farming is done by giant machines far away, and everyone has a lot of leisure time - yet our politics seems to be much more dysfunctional than when people were more self-sufficient. Aristotle does acknowledge that too much leisure and luxury can weaken successive generations, and he emphasizes the education in the virtues as the remedy for this. Maybe there is something to this, or maybe it is just that those effete artsy Greek's don't see the value in good old-fashioned hard work.

Hence there are two parts of good government; one is the actual obedience of citizens to the laws, the other part is the goodness of the laws which they obey; they may obey bad laws as well as good” (Book IV).“The mean condition of states is clearly best, for no other is free from faction; and where the middle class is large, there are least likely to be factions and dissensions. For a similar reason large states are less liable to faction than small ones, because in them the middle class is large; whereas in small states it is easy to divide all the citizens into two classes who are either rich or poor, and to leave nothing in the middle. And democracies are safer and more permanent than oligarchies, because they have a middle class which is more numerous and has a greater share in the government; for when there is no middle class, and the poor greatly exceed in number, troubles arise, and the state soon comes to an end” (Book IV).“For two principles are characteristic of democracy, the government of the majority and freedom. Men think that what is just is equal; and that equality is the supremacy of the popular will; and that freedom means the doing what a man likes. In such democracies everyone lives as he pleases, or in the words of Euripides, 'according to his fancy.' But this is all wrong; men should not think it slavery to live according to the rule of the constitution; for it is their salvation” (Book V).“Every man should be responsible to others, nor should any one be allowed to do just as he pleases; for where absolute freedom is allowed, there is nothing to restrain the evil which is inherent in every man. But the principle of responsibility secures that which is the greatest good in states; the right persons rule and are prevented from doing wrong, and the people have their due” (Book VI).

93,3,Xenophon,"Carnes Lord's translation of Politics reminded me of how philosophy is one part the Author's insights/reasoning and another part the student's reaction. I slowly chewed this text over the course of a few months because I wanted to wrestle with Aristotle as a reasonably educated man rather than take the text in as. The old man delivered. A few piecemeal insights- first, this is a continuation of Nichomachean Ethics. They can both be seen as one large lecture series. Politics delves into the communal ramifications of the previous course and couples it with fresh insights and a load of historical references. Indeed, unless you are an expert in Mediterranean history between 500BC and 300BC, you'll need a text with good notes and a lot of patience. This University of Chicago edition does that just fine. Second, this is a foundation text of Western philosophy. Like all others of its kind, it records the thoughts of a true genius. A man who sat around and thought through every aspect of existence. He is far from right in all things, but even where the reader finds him wrong, they will find something familiar backed up with a stone wall of reasoning. Westerners have been talking back and forth with Aristotle for a long, long time. As such, there are books that I think are more profitable for the modern reader- books with similar (if not better) insights, but more navigable language, and more readily grasped historical references. But can you call yourself truly educated if you have never given the OG a try? It's like calling yourself an expert in film without knowing Citizen Kane. I would write more if I had the time for it, but suffice it to say, this is an essential. I only deducted a star because I enjoyed the Carnes Lord translation a little less than the other Aristotle translations I have read. Maybe one day Robert C. Bartlett will crank one out. If and when he does, I'll be ready to give the sage of logic another try. Hopefully a better historical background.

94,4,Jakub Ferencik,"Plato originally suggested that the elites can best rule over the people. Plato argued that cardinal virtues guide the elite, the philosopher-kings, which is why they take rule since they set away earthly desires. Aristotle dismissed this idea because he believed it ignored human nature. For Aristotle, a conception of human nature, as seen in Plato's Republic, ignored the importance of providing citizens, even the elite philosopher-kings, the mundane pleasures of life. We should pay attention to the goods of the body because we have human bodies that need our basic appetites, such as hunger and thirst, fulfilled.On the contrary, Aristotle thought that each citizen is best able to achieve ultimate happiness or eudaimonia when they pursue excellence in character. According to Aristotle, virtue is the middle path between the two extremes of vices, as he outlines in the Nicomachean Ethics (30). I discussed this concept in my review on that book. In Aristotle's polity, the rulers and ruled take turns in governing. The leading cause of revolution, Aristotle argued, is preventing an exchange of rule by not treating each citizen equally. Oligarchical regimes, Aristotle writes, are based on the presupposition that unequal citizens in one way are unequal in every way (Politics 187). Therefore, the oligarchical ""superiority,"" Aristotle argued, is the ultimate cause of revolution (191). ""Disproportion"" occurs when in a state that has many parts, one part grows exponentially where the others do not (193). We can see this throughout history: either when Romanian citizens in 1989, overthrew Nicolae Ceaușescu's government and shot the dictator and his wife or when the angry french mob decapitated Louis XVI during the French Revolution. Aristotle's predictions for revolt as a result of the unequal nature of oligarchies were correct. .

95,5,Aiden,"Interesting read, obviously relations between master and slave or man to woman are expressed in an outdated manner suited to classical antiquity, but particular highlights are the discussion on the best constitution and the seeming preference being aristocracy not in the sense of an extension of oligarchy but as a sort of meritocracy. Certainly one can read this and see how deeply it influences western thought. The notion that there are different levels to the four forms of constitution - democracy, monarchy, oligarchy, aristocracy - in that you can be too democratic, too oligarchic, that the prosperity and involvement of the middle class in a society as a mediator between the contending forces of rich and poor is best; that the poor in power will destroy the rich; that the rich in power will neglect the poor; that society’s happiness and well-being must be measured not against one particular section of the state but across all its members. Apply this thought to contrasting examples of communism - which if we look at China has a more oligarchic format in terms of being a democracy where the people are nominally rulers but the party there rule - liberal democracy where nominally people rule but within Britain more often than not the conservatives representing oligarchic interests of the aristocracy, monarchy and better off enjoy more or less sustained hegemony throughout British history.All in all pertinent questions raised that remain relevant today, to be too democratic means a weak state and an inability to action, not being democratic enough tends to tyranny and failure of the role of the state to safeguard the population - so dust off the republic and build a new constitutional utopia taking the best parts of what Aristotle outlines in this book...good luck.

96,6,Nick Paulter,"Politics, AristotleAn often redundant discussion, and with many examples that are somewhat historically inconsequential, but, interestingly, the government types he describes about 2500 years ago still exist, still dysfunction in nominally the same ways, still (mis)treat people in the same ways, and still transform from one to another for the same reasons. Tyrants come to power for the same reasons, people become complacent or disinterested for the same reasons, and revolutions occur for the same reasons. The examples he provides from the ancient Greek world and environs could have just as well been taken from our world during the last couple of decades. Aristotle describes the parts of a government that are basic, namely a deliberative body, a judicial body, and executors/administrators, similar to what most states have today (although execution may not be ideal). He describes the need of a welfare system to promote and teach self-sufficiency in the population, a state-sponsored educational system, etc., all of which are part of most modern societies. I thought it was remarkable, perhaps from a naïve sociopolitical perspective (of which mine is limited), that nothing has changed significantly in a political sense over the last two millennia. Interestingly, he makes a suggestion for marriage: 37 years for the man and 18 yrs for the woman, and to be wed nominally in the winter. I got the season and age difference right (although not the actual age), perhaps that’s a reason my marriage is lasting.

97,7,Aristotle,"The Politics by AristotleA book best left to the classrooms. Aristotle’s Politics is a sometimes interesting, mostly garishly boring book composed over two millennia ago. Some of it still holds up today, some of it really does not. It’s difficult to judge books that are so old but I’ll do my best to offer my thoughts on it.For one, it’s exhausting. It took me almost three months to finish this book, whereas similar sized books could be finished in under a week. Unless you are seriously invested in Greek/Classic philosophy and/or political analysis, I’d advise staying away. I had experienced Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics before this a few years back but it appears that these are two very different pieces.Secondly, it is rather well rooted in it’s time. For example, Aristotle not only believes in slavery but justifies it. This isn’t a wholehearted negative if you’re interested in exactly how they did in fact justify slavery, but otherwise the reader will be constantly held up by how often this piece does not connect well with our lives today.On the other hand, where Aristotle does do proper political analysis that is disconnected from his period, the book shines. These parts were my favorite to read and is an example of good philosophy. I also liked how Aristotle’s use of far more empirical evidence than his contemporaries gave his arguments more bite.Overall, the Politics is an interesting look into the world of 4th century BC politics and thinking. Aristotle articulates himself in a way not unlike ourselves, but his world is distinctly different to ours. But as they say history doesn’t repeat, it rhymes. This is a short review because even thinking about the book now makes me tired, so I’ll be happy to move on to more modern philosophers, or perhaps no philosophy at all for a little while. I’m leaving it with a 5/10.

It’s always been a bonehead move to base ones entire ethico-political system on an assumed and self justifying natural hierarchy. Imagine you live in a democratic society with people who are poor and people who are wealthy, the wealthy exist within a position that allows them to further amass political and economic power, inequity worsens as they govern for themselves, outrage follows. Your democracy has become an oligarchy, tyranny reigns.The intelligentsia tell you to sit back and a) hold out for a messianic class of virtuous political actors to guide you to a promised pragmatic land, b) it won’t happen again if we’re all more virtuous next time, c) do both but by g-d! don’t change a thing that mightn’t be natural! Reform happens but the fundamental basis of the system doesn’t change. The situation inevitably regresses. Rinse, repeat, ad nauseam.That situation is today, yesterday, and ancient history. lt’s the sum of all the wisdom held in the pages of this book. The Politics is not a political manual, it’s a social tragedy. Aristotle and colleagues were able to see what was going wrong but lacked the (academic) virtue to escape Grecian teleology. A fault modern readers, one hopes, can themselves overcome. Read the classics, stop living them.

99,9,Lori,"Yet another classic that was cherry-picked into oblivion in order to justify just about anything. But unlike Plato, Aristotle uses a better way of analysing human society, that of organic growth rather than pure linearly analytical. Lewis Mumford in ""The City in History"" (p. 184) puts it best:Yet just because Aristotle's philosophy was basically that of a biologist, rather than a mathematician, he brought to the discussion of cities something that Plato lacked: a knowledge of the immense variety of species and an appreciation of the endless creative manifestations of life itself. With this came an understanding of the teleological, goal-seeking, self-actualizing nature of all organisms, and of the natural limits that define normal growth. For Aristotle, the ideal was not a rationally abstract form to be arbitrarily imposed on the community: it was rather a form already potential in the very nature of the species, needing only to be brought out and developed.While the developmental, organic metaphor might be a better way of thinking about human society, that does not excuse some absurd conclusions like the justification of slavery or sexism. Aristotle is the prime example of having human prejudices projected onto nature, and then using that projection to justify the initial prejudice as natural.

I primarily used the selections provided in the Signet Classics Philosophy of Aristotle book. His ideas here are pretty revolutionary given the time period. He also responds to various theories promulgated by Socrates and Plato. You need to have some background knowledge to fully grasp the book but his views are widely adopted today. The introductions of the Oxford world classics book and Signet Classics book was helpful though. The Oxford version contains substantially more background information and detail which I will revisit in 2021. I'll have to reread portions of this book that were not included in the Signet Classic selections sometime in the future. Pretty good read though.The Oxford world classic featuring the translation from Ernest Barker is light years ahead of the Signet Classic version. I only bought the latter because it had several of Aristotle's works (selections only) and was selling at a cheap price of $8 as opposed to $16 for just one of Aristotle's works.

He writes about the perfect state the differences of democracy, oligarchy and tyranny and also says that the long lasting states are a mixture of democracy and oligarchy and can be described as both.He would say that 90% of us are not citizens (subjects) and therefore shouldn't vote of matters of the state because only statesmen have that right or super wealthy. Loads of passages why social or making things equal in wealth and property doesn't work simply put humans get comfortable and then want more cuz we are idiots.Amazing to think this was written 3000 years ago and we are still in these same cycles or could with depressing that we are still doing this.Talks about education and eugenics and keeping the population down to two children probably not a bad idea but seems cold also he'd kill me and my crip brothers so aristotle bit of a bastard but trying to find the reason for a state to help people like me still grappling.It is always the weaker who go in search of justice and equality; the stronger reck nothing of them.

Mostly not, but partially for lack of a solid knowledge base about Ancient Greece, and partially because I don't find slavery to be a natural condition and don't believe women to be inferior. I'm glad I read Plato's Republic before this one and I wish I had read Plato's Laws and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics before this as well, among other general histories. That aside, did he make me think? Certainly. The idea that constitutions , ideal constitutions for specific states, should be different and likely shifting, according to conditions at the time is a interesting thought. Was our constitution the best possible constitution when it was written (during an agrarian society)? Does our constitution represent the best constitution we could have now (for a highly industrialized and technological society)? Interesting to think about. This is by no means an easy book to read, partially because it probably was never meant to a book, as such. The 1/3 editor's notes and 2/3 Aristotle writings was a good mix. I'd like to come back to this in a decade or two, for now i'd say it's a thought provoking & difficult read.

Hope to tackle Metaphysics and Physics, as well.Again, it is kind of silly to give a rating to Aristotle, but my rating is a nod to the edition. For each chapter of The Politics, Trevor Saunders provides a brief introduction and overview of what is to come, often providing historical context as well as insights into how the Greek has been translated. Extremely useful for tackling the text itself.Meanwhile, reading Aristotle was a surprisingly startling experience for me both for how relevant many of his observations are to today's political landscape, but also how different his world and many of the things he took for granted were (see for instance his discussion of slavery). His writing is very accessible with very little in terms of complicated philosophical jargon. Saunders is helpful in guiding the first time reader through Aristotle's larger themes, such as his teleological take on the world, without getting mired in the centuries of debate that have surrounded these ideas.Well worth the effort!

I found Aristotle's classification of constitutions not only as relevant as ever, but actually universally. Every state that ever existed and will exist will invariably fall under one - or more likely several - of the 6 forms of government described in the book: tyranny, monarchy, oligarchy, aristocracy, democracy, constitutional government.What I found remarkable, especially compared to Plato's Republic, is the inductive method Aristotle uses. He looks at many of the city states of his time and before his time, and compares the different constitutions and their relative success. From these real life data points, he draws conclusions as to which are the best constitutions for different types of city states. Aristotle really did put the ""science"" in ""political science"".It's definitely not an easy read and I'm deducting 1 star for the long and vague passages around the mid section of the book, but I would highly recommend it to anyone the least bit interested in politics.

Plato tried to discover and theorize and had an open but almost charming bias for philosophers. Aristotle tries to be objective, but while some of Plato's ideas are progressive even for our time, much of Aristotle's assumptions are stuck in ancient Athens.Aristotle is great and vital for any student of science or philosophy. But, he spends a lot more time describing things than creating and arguing philosophical theories. The Politics, I fear, is not very important any longer. Where it does shine, and where it takes my attention is his criticism of Plato's idea of having women and children in commen. It was a strange and poorly supported part of the Republic, and Aristotle rightly argues that it is likely irrelevant to a good state, and worse, potentially destructive to it. The commentary on Plato was the best then. You can see I'm biased, but perhaps my point is still understandable and valid despite it.

107,17,Raymond Raad,"This book is surprisingly good, and in a sense it is modern too. He poses many of the same questions that arise today in forming a political order. His influence on the founding fathers is obvious as well. Essentially Aristotle is trying to solve the problem of how a large number of people can live together most productively. He has an individualist perspective - the fundamental unit of society is the individual and the nuclear family. He ultimately favors a type of limited democracy but is aware of the ways it can lead to tyranny. So he moderates it through the rule of law, through an active and large middle class, and through some oligarchic elements. He is concerned that each strata of society has enough of a role. He is also concerned that the meritorious have a role in the society, and struggles to ensure that they have a role through moderation. Seems to me that today, Aristotle would support a strong congress, the electoral college, and federalism as moderating forces.

Politics is derived from ""polis"" the Greek word for city, which was seen as an ideal community in which human beings could flourish and informs Aristotle's investigation. He goes into advantages and weaknesses of different constitutions and regimes (particularly focusing on monarchy, oligarchy, and democracy), comparisons of how a city-state should be run relative to a household or even marriage, what constitutes a citizen, and the education of a city-state to ensure it's prosperity. It can get a bit tedious at times (and perhaps I am feeling Ancient Greek philosophy-fatigue), but no one can deny Aristotle's incisive analysis and his honesty in questioning his own preconceived notions. What makes Aristotle's writings so special is his comfort in leaving the reader without a clear answer but plenty of legitimate viewpoints.

For me, the interest of ancients systems on ancient terms are rather lame, but there was still from time to times parts that were very interesting to read. I would say the three last books are the best out of them all. As for Aristotle, we can see he uses the ideas developed in earlier works while exploring politics, but it seems to me that this part is less cut in stone - less assured and much more of a time-sensitive matter.

123,3,Denis Kovalev,"Hard to rate such a classic book that on the one hand is closely tied to the life perception of that era and on the other hand is so thoughtful, clean and contains the ideas that were preserved through the centuries almost intact.This is a must-read for those interested in politics, social order and interactions between the citizens and the country. It discloses what it means to be a citizen, what political systems exist and why. Aristotle as a master of human nature analyses what it means to be happy and how people can achieve it being in a group and forming and belonging to a country.

124,4,Elizabeth Jennings,"Valuable and careful thinking about what it means to be a citizen and what kinds of regime are best. The biggest takeaway for me was that being a ""good citizen"" is not the same as being a virtuous person--in a ""deviant regime,"" a ""good citizen"" is actually a bad person! Giving four stars because the presentation style is so dry it really takes the motivation of reading with a group to get through it. Fortunately I had an excellent group to read this with, at summer classics at St. John's College.

125,5,Jayme,"I...did not like this book. As other reviewers have noted, it's hard to review a classic, much less a foundational text. But while I can appreciate the project of this book and much of its execution, most of it was not particularly edifying, and a good half of it quite hard to get through. My favorite sections were in the middle, when different government systems (democracy vs oligarchy etc.) were discussed. I learned something new that I could apply to my thinking about nations today. But I feel like I wasted a fair bit of time to get there.

126,6,Justin,"A surprisingly relevant ancient account of politics including the importance of constitutional authority, the influence of money in politics, demagoguery, and the education of citizens. Some insights include that the more that money influences politics, the closer it is to oligarchy (political rights proportionate to wealth), rather than equality of rights for all (democracy). Aristotle asserts that those who promote virtue deserve the greatest share of power. How to make this happen relies on the education of the citizens who support such individuals.

127,7,Eli,"Sage. Fascinating. In contrast to the abstract, idealistic, and impractical Republic of Plato, Aristotle thinks about politics with his feet firmly planted on the ground. His rooting of government in nature and family agrees with the Bible. Aristotle suggests that there are several legitimate forms of government, which can each work, provided that citizens are virtuous and leaders are wise. There is much to learn from here. It is a wonder this is not more widely read, since so many simply political blunders would be exposed and avoided.

Aristotle, considered to be a master at formal logic, shows his weakness in reasoning, by assuming it to be just for the ""greater to rule the lesser.""

256,16,M. Ashraf,"This was a very dense piece on politics and it's fascinating that this book was written this long ago.I've read ""The Republic"" by Plato and in comparison between the two this was more reasonable than the first and then The republic wasn't that much on comparing government rather than building the perfect model he talked briefly about the forms of government around him , but this was more intense in classifying them talking about each form separately and then comparing them , finally trying to figure the best form it was great.The only point that I favorite ""The Republic"" over ""Politics"" is the view of Socrates to the women , the slaves , the marriage and the labor class.Beside that the ""Politics"" is my favorite in every other aspect , more reasonable but not a visionary , he stated facts , some historical incident around him , he didn't give much his direct view on the best form of government.As ""The Republic"" came first , there was lots of remarking on ""The Republic"" and it wasn't the usual critic rather than an attack on each point he thought it was a flaw in it.Between the Two Plato or Aristotle both were geniuses and I'm going to read ""The Law"" and ""The Ethics"" and continue Socrates dialogues :)Some of points I liked :-Man is by nature a political animal.A constitution is the organization of offices in a state, and determines what is to be the governing body, and what is the end of each community. But laws are not to be confounded with the principles of the constitution; they are the rules according to which the magistrates should administer the state, and proceed against offenders.The demagogues make the decrees of the people override the laws, by referring all things to the popular assembly. And therefore they grow great, because the people have an things in their hands, and they hold in their hands the votes of the people, who are too ready to listen to them. Further, those who have any complaint to bring against the magistrates say, 'Let the people be judges'; the people are too happy to accept the invitation; and so the authority of every office is undermined. Such a democracy is fairly open to the objection that it is not a constitution at all; for where the laws have no authority, there is no constitution. The law ought to be supreme over all, and the magistracies should judge of particulars, and only this should be considered a constitution.The happy life is the life according to virtue lived without impediment, and that virtue is a mean, then the life which is in a mean, and in a mean attainable by every one, must be the best.The best political community is formed by citizens of the middle class, and that those states are likely to be well-administered in which the middle class is large, and stronger if possible than both the other classes, or at any rate than either singly; for the addition of the middle class turns the scale, and prevents either of the extremes from being dominant.Those who think that all virtue is to be found in their own party principles push matters to extremes; they do not consider that disproportion destroys a state.Every man should be responsible to others, nor should any one be allowed to do just as he pleases; for where absolute freedom is allowed, there is nothing to restrain the evil which is inherent in every man. But the principle of responsibility secures that which is the greatest good in states; the right persons rule and are prevented from doing wrong, and the people have their due. It is evident that this is the best kind of democracy.

262,22,E.C.,"The shocking revelation of Aristotle's Politics is that it stands as a near perfect mirror of modern society's political discourse. Aristotle first addresses the definitions of various forms of governments (tyrannies, oligarchies, democracies, etc.), then lays out the possible intentions and purposes of government, and describes their suitability to specific city-states in existence in the 300s BC. In this way, he balances theory with reality, and acknowledges the imperfections of all forms of government in relation to their creators and enforcers, be they leaders, royalty or the masses. A great deal of Politics refers to civic duty, and the final chapters delve into citizenry and education. It's altogether surprising that the final few pages are devoted entirely to music, what kind of music a citizen should learn and listen to, what instruments should be studied, how bold the music should be, etc. (Note that Politics is likely an incomplete work, so perhaps Aristotle intended to round out his discourse with a more appropriate ending than ""The Power of Music,"" although I found it refreshing and ripe with opportunity to infer deeper meaning.) It would be deceptively easy to dismiss Politics as obsolete based purely on his treatment of women and slaves (both are essentially property; they serve a purpose, but that purpose is hardly representative of modern, individualist values.) In reading past the bigotry, there is an amazing, constant revelation in this treatise: civilization continues to ask the same questions, turn up the same answers, make the same mistakes, and grow incredibly slowly, if at all. In the arena of politics, we (global ""we"") are fundamentally no different today than we were thousands of years ago. The question that Aristotle's Politics then answers is not ""what is the best form of government"" but ""what government should each citizenry live with?"" Given America's constant assertion that democracy is best, this book stokes the debate by suggesting that democracy may be best for us, based on our self-defined values, but is it necessarily best for everyone? Further, using Aristotle's unemotional, unbiased definitions, it's clear that America isn't actually a democracy at all. We are therefore advocating a system of government for other countries that we ourselves cannot uphold. Anyone with a desire to understand America's current turmoil without emotional rhetoric muddying the water will enjoy this book. It's written with elegant simplicity and is accessible to the widest spectrum of readers.

263,23,Laura,"I studied this in a class in college. I found some of the ideas presented in it deeply troubling, especially when I considered the name of Aristotle which has been thrown about as a kind of father of modern thought and the touchstone of the modern embodiment of democracy. I found it strange to consider the idea of women and slave-men as lesser beings than the intellectual man idealised in this text. The way it was presented to us was just as points to consider, to hold in the context of a debate and I found myself asking the question, as a woman, is there a case for this? (Point to note: the lecturer was also a woman). It kind of made me think that its no wonder that some people hold the views they do in our society. It also made me think of the way some people are looked down upon as lesser because they do not have x,y,z type of education and how manual labour can be handed off to those least able to refuse it, not necessarily those who are least intelligent. It kind of suggested to me a power imbalance and the danger of taking your own perspective too seriously and identifying too strongly with your own gender or those of a similar background to you. I suppose it was an enlightening book to read in a way because it made me ask; what are the ways that I do this and not even realise it? I suppose the difficult part was seeing the logic of some of his arguments but being unhappy with the conclusion he came to. I almost felt complicit in this worldview because I was listening as part of a class and rather than outright rejection of these notions, we were looking to see the message behind them or what they could infer in our modern age. I only took this class as a single module so I don't have in depth knowledge of political texts to compare this to but I could all too readily see the biases inherent in this form of reasoning in the business world, which is where my specialisation was. I guess it did make me re-evaluate my perspective but more in terms of turning away from what he was proposing rather than towards it. I felt that if a collective is not mindful of all the individuals that make it up, then it is a dictatorship by default with scope for limited freedom within those lines. So, overall, it was not what I had anticipated.

264,24,Brian Schiebout,"Politics by Aristotle and translated into English by Benjamin Jowett is an ancient book about political science. Aristotle truly believed that politics was a science which could be understood in the same way as anatomy or physics. Because of that he wrote this book to help people create a better more stable state. He starts by explaining the way in which a household is like a miniature state and explaining the rules which must be put into place regarding women, children and slaves all of which he seen as less than fully functional beings. After dealing with this he begins his description of the different types of states which he divides into six main primary forms. The first three which he would describe as proper states are monarchy, aristocracy and constitutional government. After that he describes the three corrupted forms as tyranny, oligarchy , and democracy. Monarchy is when one person who is the best in the state rules under the law for the sake of his citizens. This government though is often corrupted into tyranny where one person through strength holds his equals or betters below himself for his own benefit. Aristocracy is when the people who are above average join together to wisely run the state so that it might prosper. Often though it degrades into oligarchy where the power is all in the hands of a few who use the power to try maintain their position. Constitutional government is when people willingly submit to wise laws which are put together to help the state. Democracy is its corrupted form where the poor and the lesser people hold all the power and the better people are ostracized. After explaining these different states he goes on to show how each form of government can be transformed through revolution into another and how a wise leadership group will encourage stability in their state so their government is not overthrown. The final section of the book details his description of a perfect state and how the children should be educated. Overall a good book which is formative in its field of study.

265,25,Graham Cammock,"Aristotle's Politics is a masterpiece, he starts off talking about how a city (polis) is a compound, with the parts or elements consisting of the household, the village and then the city. A city is a political association or 'sharing', with the end goal of the city being the good life or having the leisure time to engage in politics. Not all people can attain the good life, in order for some people to attain it, some people have to do the menial or degrading tasks, such as slaves, mechanics and manual labourers. He describes how household management consists of the master-slave, husband-wife, or father-children relationships, which correspond to how rulers of the city relate to their subjects. Aristotle discusses constitutions at length, which is how the various political offices of a city are organised. Constitutions are grouped in to two corresponding groups of right and perverted: kingship, aristocracy and 'constitutional government' against tyranny, oligarchy and democracy. Although oligarchy and democracy are classified as perverted constitutions, these are the constitutions Aristotle spends most of the book talking about. He then discusses how the various constitutions are destroyed through factional fighting and how they are best preserved. Aristotle explores every possibility or combination in order I suspect to avoid criticism; he leaves no stone unturned. He then goes on to describe how children should be educated by the city and not privately, in reading and writing, drawing, gymnastics and music. The last chapter is devoted to music education. The work is deep and technical, it's amazing how advanced the Greek philosophers were in the 4th century BC, as compared to the not so much earlier biblical writers of Israel. The analysis of the politics of the city (polis) is a universal example or analogy of the workings of any modern state. One really gains confidence in statecraft and politics, even when applied to large modern states. The translators notes are also imperative. I highly recommend this book to anyone!

266,26,Oscar Despard,"Aristotle’s ‘Politics’ is a fascinating read. For the most part, this book discusses different ways in which states may be constructed. Arguments for and against each form of constitution are presented, and the defects of the reasoning used to justify each are displayed to the reader. Aristotle's ideas, coming as they do from a different era, are different and thought-provoking. Calling democracy a ‘deviated’ constitution is unthinkable today, but it is a possibility that is worth exploring. Just one instance of the intriguing ideas raised in this book is Aristotle’s view that democracy may (in the situation where the people, under the control of a demagogue, are allowed to rule by decree against the rich) be tantamount to tyranny (the demagogue being able to control popular opinion). This seems hugely relevant to the populist wave sweeping over the political world at the moment.‘The Politics’ was not written as a single volume; it was compiled from several sets of Aristotle’s notes, and is therefore somewhat disjointed in places. However, thanks to the way it has been presented, it is a remarkably easy read. Brief introductions to each chapter sum up the main points before the reader even begins, which allows for a pleasant experience even if (like me) you have no prior knowledge of Greek history or political theory. This book is not perfect; Book I in particular is devoted largely to muddled justifications of slavery and misogyny. However, on the whole, this book gives an insight into so many different aspects of the political issues we discuss today, from underlining the importance of private property ownership to the dangers inherent in democracy that it is impossible not to recommend it. It is absorbing, thought-provoking and interesting, and is well worth a read.

267,27,Bob Nichols,"Aristotle's Politics is a continuation of his central theme in the Ethics. Man's distinctive feature is his rationality and rational guidance - generally the mean in behavioral expression - is virtuous behavior resulting in the Supreme Good, happiness. The state's role is to support the development and maintenance of this virtuous individual, which includes the rule over those who are not capable of ruling themselves (slaves). Aristotle places great stock in rationality and has created an ideal man that seems to have dominated much of Western philosophy. It's not that rational control of the passions are not important. Rather, it's that the ability of rationality to control (moderate according to the mean) emotions (passions, need) that is in question. Then the task is to move beyond the development of rational man, and toward designing a government and moral system to deal with this darker reality, which, if human history is our guide (Durant), must be entertained. Aristole notes in passing that a most common source of injustice is insult. Insult, along with anger, revenge, fear, contempt and hatred are ancient, pre-rational forms of behavior that lie just beneath, if not pervade, civility, that drive behavior and are so often beyond the reach of rational control. Minimizing these influences among the ruling elements in society is the book's' weakspot. Aristotle's regard for natural slavery is a bit much as is his claim about the superiority of Hellenic civilization as compared to Europe and China that depart from the Hellenic mean. This should caution those who look to Aristole as a source of universal truth. Having said all of this, his vast collection and organization of all things related to the government of his times is very impressive.

Most of these pieces I had read previously during my masters program a couple of years ago. It's good quality stuff that still holds true today (mostly). I think it is important that we always have these to look back on, and to learn from. A lot of it is a bit dry, but that's mainly due to the writing style of the time these were written. Some are a little boring, but there are just as many, if not more that are exciting and engaging, though that could just be my inner poli sci nerd rearing her little head.

269,29,Mohammad Ali Abedi,"""A master is only the master of the slave, but no part of him; but the slave is not only the slave of the master, but nothing else but that.""The problem with today’s western world can be directly linked to their ancient philosophy. Sure, they might be proud of it, but in it, there is no real beauty, no love of life, no spirituality, not in terms of religion, but in terms of something more important.Aristotle’s thesis on politics is not only cold and emotionless (and frankly, boring), it’s also unchanged for the mentality of today’s western method of politics. I’m not saying that Aristotle has influenced politics greatly, because to be honest, I don’t see Aristotle as a unique voice in his time, but basically just a voice of not only his time, but his people. Aristotle seems to basically be talking about how politics were fun at that time and his support of it, and by extension, not much has changed since then.""He who proposes to make that inquiry which is necessary concerning what government is best, ought first to determine what manner of living is most eligible; for while this remains uncertain it will also be equally uncertain what government is best: for, provided no unexpected accidents interfere, it is highly probable, that those who enjoy the best government will live the most happily according to their circumstances; he ought, therefore, first to know what manner of life is most desirable for all; and afterwards whether this life is the same to the man and the citizen, or different.""

270,0,Reece,"It is boring, often incoherent (which I am learning is a theme of Aristotle's works as I trudge through the equally meandering 'Nicomachean Ethics'), and serves to better historically gauge political theory of antiquity and political structure of antiquity than to actually translate relevant ideas to the modern reader. Defenses of patriarchal structure, slavery, and the like are some of the foundational arguments lied down in the book; it also leads from the NE's position on what eudaimonia is and how it can be achieved, with respect to achieving this in a political city-state. This is problematic (for me) because Aristotle's arguments in 'Nicomachean Ethics' wind around countless presumptions, contradictions, and pretensions. This means that my foundation for 'Politics' already sucks and leaves the entering reader cynical, that is, if they critically read through the Ethics. His dogma is irritating to no end to boot.I also don't care much about the discourse surrounding the original texts being lecture notes vs actual books, etc, when reviewing this. I take it into context, but context does not necessarily dictate quality for me. It is frustrating, boring, and ridiculous. But at least you have read another Aristotle book and are that much closer to being in on the ""great conversation"" of philosophy, or whatever some pretensious university cuck might call it.I recommend passing by this shitshow. There are a lot of greater books to read, and better ways to spend your time.

271,1,Toby,"The Politics is on the face of it a sequel to the Nichomachean ethics - at least the final chapter of the latter work sets up the Politics as the ethical outworking of Aristotle's philosophy. The Politics is not such a neat work as Ethics, tailing off slightly unsatisfactorily with a discussion about the place of music in education and spending rather too long examining different kinds of ancient Greek constitution. Even so, it rightly sits at along with Plato's Republic as the cornerstone of Western political thinking.Reading this made me wonder what Aristotle would make of Twenty-First Century British politics. Broadly, British political life fits in with his idea of a democratic-oligarchic mix with the people having a vote but the ""governing class"" effectively making laws. I think that he would be appalled at the idea of a referendum - probably rightly so given the poor quality of the debate over the EU - and he would have been disturbed at the growing inequality in society which he felt pulled societies apart.His comments on education seem rather more to the point. When discussing the place of art in education: both for an appreciation of beauty and for commercial advantage he notes ""to be constantly asking 'what use is it?' is unbecoming to those of great soul (megalopsuchos) and unworthy of free men.""

272,2,Hershel Shipman,"Well this is a fundamental political/philosophy book. Aristotle is equivalently wrong on several accounts but on many others I find myself agreeing with him.Some of the things I found to be wrong are: Some people being more slavie than others. Women being unequal to men, his idea's that the Greeks were superior to everyone around them, and his utter fascination with monarchies. However, some of this comments on how the best possible scenario for a state is to have a middle class larger than either its upper or lower were spot on. His comments on having a varied and liberal education as being important to being a good citizen applies today. His view that music should be one of the foundational parts of a person's education is one I agree with in totality. Also the fact that being a good citizen and a good person have little to do with each other.I will probably reread this book again after I devour more philosophy, history, and ancient Greek literature.Also Aristotle should have avoided doing any amount of writings on science. He failed horrible, thought of it as a though experiment and in generial, his ideas, along with Ptolemy's caused many hurdles in advancement of knowledge, but I should leave this rant for another of his books...

Of the people I know I’m the only one who actually spoke with a candidate, we’re all too busy doing more important things than governing ourselves!In his world it made sense to think the purpose of government is to create a venue in which people can act personally to lead a good life and that for government to do otherwise would be perverse.

275,5,Phillip,"I read excerpts from this text pursuant to my dissertation. It's amazing how relevant and interesting political philosophy from the 4th century BCE can be to modern ways of thinking and understanding the world democratically. One of the main things I take from this is that the running of the polis--the body politic--is much more tied to property ownership in Aristotle's philosophy than I would like it to be, but that what characterized democracy is precisely the liberty from being ruled by those with property. Of course, today with our 'representative democracy' in the United States of Citizens United, we have a functional oligarchy, in which those with the most money to contribute to campaigns win the elections through their chosen representatives. This is, for Aristotle, probably not a democracy. It would be better if those who served in currently elected offices were not elected by a vote, but chosen by lot, as they did in ancient Athens. This would eliminate the influence of money from politics.

Following the first two books of Plato's Republic, Aristotle's ""Politics"" has a clean, fresh, brisk directness. (Platonic dialogues are good and well, but staying in the conversations too long may overwhelm one's attention and patience. ""What is the conclusion?"" The modern infant in me cried out -- naturally with apologies.)Aristotle developed his thoughts on Politics through the starting point of ""good and honorable life"". In his view, politics and government are indispensable for human to achieve such life. From household management of persons and property, Aristotle laid out a structural framework for divisions of labor, master and slave, male and female, art of war, property and wealth-getting, money and exchange commerce. What he considered ""just"" and ""good"" may shock modern sensibility, however one must remember that Aristotelian thoughts are among the deep roots of human society.

Aristotle's on his own words said that: No bounds to riches can be fixed for man's thy be gifted as in other arts; for the instrument of no art whatsoever are infinite, either in their number or their magnitude; but riches are a number of instruments in domestic and civil economy; it is therefore evident that the acquisition of cetain things according to nature is a part of both domestic and civil economy, and for what reason.

Got some stuff out of it I wouldn't have if I hadn't read Plato beforehand, but largely still felt like the same repetitive ethnography of different political systems of his period with scattered interesting philosophical propositions (i.e. man as political animal) interspersed. I found it more productive/interesting reading the Stanford entry than the text itself, which is likely a combination of his turgid style and my own lack of understanding. I think if I were to read more Aristotle I should check out Nicomachean Ethics or Metaphysics since they are more ""purely"" philosophy. The Stanford entry has convinced me that coming to greater understanding of Aristotle has lots of philosophical utility, and I also can tell there are a number of ongoing interesting hermeneutical debates, but I think I need to either take Aristotle in a class or read him with secondary literature to get much out of it.

Yet for such great distinction in eras, Aristotle offers us a remarkable discussion of enduring issues of populism and aristocracy, rule of all versus rule of some, and so on. I found a number of the insights, while dated, impressively relevant to our circumstance today. Aristotle saw some of the issues of democracy and oligarchy much clearer then than we do now.

288,18,Salma Dahab,"I have a tiny remark. I wasn't able to put the last two books 7, 8 in the map of the whole book. I mean is he describing his ideal state in a sense of ""Classical Utopia"" in which it would be unattainable, ideal, kind of criteria. Or he was describing the best attainable regime according to his perspective, so, those books would be kind of policy paper, However,The change in methodology - For political scientist to philosopher- deny this. Also, why did he ignore discussing political life in his ideal state while the whole book is revolving around this, Actually title of the book is ""POLITICS""?!,Did he left it in another place in the book or what?. Finally, I don't like him in last two books. His ideal state was a kind of repeating Plato or replying to plato.

289,19,Zach,"Aristotle is, unsurprisingly, comprehensive and relatively close to inventing political philosophy in the west (it should be noted that I haven't read The Republic or The Laws yet). With that said, there are some definite caveats to Politics. One is that Aristotle, brilliant though he is, can hardly conceive of anything other than a city-state as a form of government. He treats the concept with characteristic thoroughness, of course, but he's stuck in that idea. Another is that his quick (and depressing) ability to rattle off revolutions shows the tenuousness by which Greek governments were formed; this is a serious issue he is trying to solve (and one that would eventually be solved forcibly for the Greeks by Philip).

290,20,Briana Saussy,"Aristotle's Politics is an excellent book to read anytime, but its especially appropriate with the upcoming elections. He points out several obivous things that were not quite so obvious to me until I was reminded of them, like the possibility that you are in some part a reflection of the regime under which you live, that man is a political animal, and that speech, choice, and persuasion are in a unique relationship to one another. One of the best aspects of the book is the description of the three major types of regime and then their derivations or corrupted forms. As a teaser I will leave you with this: democracy is a derivation of...

291,21,Shad,"This is a pretty good read. He has some very interesting ideas on politics and what legislators should consider - very involved in personal lives (e.g., religious worship, marriage and child rearing). Some of the things he says are extremely offensive by today's standards and some things are downright hilarious (like saying legislators should take precautions against large discrepancies in age and then states the ideal ages for marrying are 18 for a female and 37 for a male). I did like this better than Plato's Republic, and agreed with most of Aristotle's critiques. It's a good foundational read.

292,22,Bob G,"I can understand why this is an important book historically. I was not impressed, though, by the logical approach he used, and there are many cases of ""I will cover that later"" without it ever being covered.I think the translator did a very good job of wrapping around the text very helpful notes. For anyone studying history and early forms of government this is an excellent edition.On a side note, it is very interesting to see that many things have not changed in 2500 years. The class struggles going on, even today, between the very rich and the rest of us seem to have been with us for thousands of years.

293,23,Sophia,"I'm not quite sure how people review such works. Then again, had I read it for me and not for school, having to analyze it and all I think I'd appreciate it in a different way. Nonetheless, I think I like Aristotle more than Plato. His way of saying this, his thoughts and beliefs, they were quite a read, maybe an eye opener. Of course I didn't agree with everything he said but it was a different time and age then. Anyway, I ever reread it when I'm older, I might be in a better place to grasp my thoughts and transfer them into a ""review"". I'm quoting it, because can anyone really review works like this? Now, let's hope I do good in my exams if they decide on Aristotle and not Plato.

294,24,George Sim,"A natural continuance of the Ethics, Aristotle describes all kinds of political systems, the character of the state, the character of the citizen. He gives suggestions on how the state should be organized and what is the end of the state. The fact that much of his work has been lost, makes the book incomplete and the work unfinished. So, the reader is not shown any conclusions to Aristotle's contemplation. Politics could be related to Plato's The Republic in some aspects, although Aristotle many times criticizes his mentor and his sayings in similar matters. Overall, an interesting book with many insights on political systems of the ancient world, but with limited conclusive context.

295,25,James Lang,"Well it feels a little strange to give three stars to Aristotle, but I read this directly after reading the Ethics and it just doesn't hold up as well. The Ethics remains for me a fundamental life-guiding text. The Politics, with its opening on slavery and the natural differences among humans and their implications for political life, just doesn't hold up in the same way. So my three stars are for the extent to which this text still offers value to our thinking about how to live a good life. Important and worthwhile insights remain here, especially about the need for balance and proportion in a state, but there is much in here also that has just not stood the test of time.

296,26,Milena M,"Here Aristotle represents some of the fundamental ideas on politics of his times and gives a profound picture of reasoning and principles for life in Greek city-states. He uses quite an easy language which makes this book a quick read for its kind. Some points are really interesting and relevant even nowadays but most seem to be outdated. The author speaks through the ages in many ways giving an opportunity to look behind the curtain of the ancient mindset.This book is definitely a source of knowledge survived through the ages and became a part of modern scholars as cultural and social artifact of the ancient history.

297,27,Cami,"There is more relevant information in this book than you'd think. Since the book is really just a compilation of Aristotles notes for several lectures, there was a lot of repetition and I had to do some skimming. However, I really enjoyed the discussion about ultimate good, and the different types of government and what the pitfalls will be for each, as well as the discussion on how important family is to the state. I also enjoyed learning how his thoughts are received today. It was an important read.

298,28,K,"Contains Aristotle's ideas for what governments work best. He personally would love a benevolent monarchy, but thinks the most workable government form in the real world is a mixture of oligarchic & democratic forms, with as much power as possible held by the middle class. Also, he really believes in slavery (some people's natures are just better suited to being slaves, he says), and harshes on Sparta for giving too much power to women. Because don't they know women need to stay in the house because their brains aren't strong and they're full of irrationality?

299,29,Jason Jewell,"Many of the modern world's problems are the result of its forgetting the lessons of Aristotle. This treatise discusses the importance of widespread property ownership for ensuring order, and exposes the dangerous lie that any unmixed form of government (democracy as well as monarchy or aristocracy) ever concerns itself with the welfare of everyone in the society. Important insights are present on almost every page on questions such as citizenship, the proper scale of cities, etc. Read slowly and with a highlighter!
