3,Erick,despite warnings protests received goodreads friends reading aristotle politics current political situations vice versa attempt review unapologetically obviously well aware aristotle lived 2300 years ago indeed would pretty ignorant reading degree aware fact completed almost whole corpus minus zoological writings eudemian ethics also fully aware societal conditions change subtle subtle ways always amazed though particular tendency people consider anything decades old passé obsolete sure goodreads friends guilty degree naivety remember debating someone american founding fathers whether ideas still relevant current political situations yes someone actually taking position founding father views republic formed relevant today obviously extreme example clueless people comes ideas relationship progress feeling arguing past thinkers held demonstrably different ideas spoke freedom equality rights laws ethics etc etc et al simply playing game equivocation using time accomplice charade know goodreads friends extreme least hope read philosophy one considers ideas shelf life certainly practical uses one time case cognizant warnings friends provided warnings without merit preceding introduction hopefully provided defense following review review also make clear aristotle ideas still relevant certainly willing debate merits benjamin jowett translation taking correct burden proof though person questions jowett translation present greek words english terms consider correct rendering take seriously textual criticisms offer evidence source material substantiation saying someone claimed something aristotle substantiated argument far concerned one provides sources evidence certainly take seriously want first address one issue brought forth comment aristotle plato experience exact kind democracy know today aristotle believed equality equality similars e men certain status accepted citizens sharing similar condition qualified equals equality based humanity alone slaves women children included citizenship greek city states aristotle indeed follow precedent certainly one way democracy changed course changes made relatively recently basing equality human alone element added democratic ideals subsequently one probably note christian ethics largely influence behind innovation however reasons including status e g owning wealth property military service etc questions citizenship aristotle day something going get talk dangers democracy always existed say support ancient greek perspective question clearly matter political system one falls category disenfranchised listed systems would tyrannical case system take account inherent human value questions equality system except equivocal sense one note absolutely question political systems west including america rooted greco roman precedent undeniable ethics morals mention religious ideals rooted judeo christian precedent certainly opinion first wrote topics still something teach us ideas often still applicable read bible believe morals ethics entirely relevant us move away preceding worse society like manner earliest writers political systems inspired still entirely relevant people often much grasp occurred greek city states greeks experimented different forms government topics debated writing lived cannot stress enough political systems referred plato aristotle removing speculative elements added tested humanity changed much 2300 years example mentioned review cicero moral duties socialism communism new idea aristotle aware one potential abuse democracy demagogue promised disenfranchised would take money property wealthy give supported provide quotes obviously even one property necessarily mean ancient democracy one recourse gaining political power aristotle wary kind political abuses possible within democracy believed cicero every person respected property respecting property rights people sure way bring revolution longer problem american republic think guess party harboring socialists respect fundamental human right property know situation aristotle cicero wrote possible even today aristotle mentions one place democracies often descend specific abuses often came form politician scapegoating well exemplified following quote democracy tyrants borrowed art making war upon notables destroying secretly openly exiling rivals stand way power also plots contrived men class either want rule escape subjection applies also wealthy aristotle also makes clear revolutions democracies generally caused intemperance demagogues either private capacity lay information rich men compel combine coming forward public stir people course notable element communist socialist countries modern world risk democracy noted numerous examples democracy would shift oligarchy back eventually descending tyranny aristotle incredibly critical pure democracy majority absolute control minority aristotle calls worst form tyranny pure democracy 51 people absolute control 49 people interestingly enough percentages provided pretty close liberals conservatives respectively taking account moderates like america unsurprisingly many connected american political party takes name democracy often support pure democratic ideals even constitution bill rights open popular vote mitigating control pure democracy aristotle calls constitutional government includes constitutional government heading democracy undoubtedly considered distinct constitutional government would term today constitutional republic technically democracy republic ancient greek sources modern parlance distinct united states indeed aristotle saw best form government exemplified following quote two principles characteristic democracy government majority freedom men think equal equality supremacy popular freedom equality mean man likes democracies every one lives pleases words euripides according fancy wrong men think slavery live according rule constitution salvation aristotle saw balance needed struck law e constitution freedom e democracy losing balance catastrophic following quote make clear oligarchy democracy although departure perfect form may yet good enough government one attempts push principles either extreme begin spoiling government end none laws carried excess one element state ruined constitution ruined aristotle knew full well pure democracies gave way anarchy oligarchy suspicious democracies reason democracies everyone wants equal words george orwell want equal others part problem aristotle political thinkers day develop system would minimize eliminate inequities populace allow role government without sacrificing competent voices less competent voices may appear shocking one keep mind aristotle point view everyone equally competent share government even grant everyone equal far category species goes obviously ancient greek attempt minimize incompetent say government correct one time acknowledge vast percentage population exists society period time competent enough political power people given population knowledgeable enough informed opinion government aristotle greeks probably assumed one gained certain position status indicated competence men seen competent mentally women slaves lacked status education citizens children yet competent prior proper education education seen fundamental aristotle view governmental longevity provide quote aristotle example position things mentioned contributes permanence constitutions adaptation education form government yet day principle universally neglected need appreciate greeks like aristotle concerned rule ignorant populace must acknowledge also condemning attempts controlling unjust method aristotle seems acknowledge even citizens often ignorant tyranny majority happens populace ignorant self seeking make sound political decisions american founding fathers set particular system curb tyranny majority ignorant factions country easily become tribalist disinterested health society whole precursor social unrest civil war e aristotle terms revolution happens instance disenfranchised group gains citizenship every societal benefit comes citizenship development seen adequate optimal outcome others simply good enough may insist need special rights citizens enjoy feel equal make feelings past societal marginalization aristotle says universal chief cause revolutionary feeling mentioned already viz desire equality men think equal others desire inequality superiority conceiving superior think less inferiors pretensions may may inferiors revolt order may equal equals may superior aristotle attributed revolutionary feeling factors need based reality need perceived true play ignorant human tendency cicero also took note tendency people self seeking concerned superiority equality even claiming seeking equality equality attained wise good consider adequate neither wise good consider adequate archaic inapplicable human tendency still much present democracies pure democracy mob rule democracy healthy breeding ground political parties harbor socialists communists anarchists indeed constitution safeguard kinds corrupting influences aristotle also concerned wearing away constitution removing tenets little little time aristotle says revolution may accomplished small degrees mean great change may sometimes slip constitution neglect small matter says relation aristocratic constitutional government doubt would consider effects different democratic constitutional government citizens begin giving part constitution greater ease government change something else little important undermined whole fabric state one certainly find example sort thing country recently long ago president instituted something called patriot act serious breach constitution allowed data collection things compromised rights citizens aristotle aware day tyrants utilized informants infiltrate almost every aspect societal life informants data collectors aristotle day aristotle knew rightly tactics tyrants desirable free society interestingly enough also noted tyrants often attempted keep populace focused things pertinent role government could take form fighting foreign wars infighting groups within society leave reader decide still happens sort thing still relevant today democracies preceding thoughts reading every review simply collection thoughts anything read far believing aristotle wrote irrelevant today indeed feel quite opposite like nicomachean ethics preceding volume politics aristotle believed moderation believed political balance freedom law democracy constitutional government suspicious extremes think astute appraisal politics would well take position regards politics today may much hope considering moderate libertarian reader see adequate defense political moderation hopefully fact new idea position thinkers past may give merit giving book 4 star review book caused reflect quite bit reject aristotle caste system certain people denied citizenship rights also find defense infanticide incredibly abhorrent hardly surprising one considers position value children,really liked it,4

rodzajach ustrojów panujących w starożytności autor opisuje zarówno wady jak zalety takich ustrojów ciekawą rzeczą jest że w wielu miejscach widać że socjalizm jej pokrewne idee nie są niczym nowym ponieważ autor wielokrotnie wspomina choćby ustrojach które próbowały ustawić równość u ludzi lub też grabić bogatych na rzecz biednych jeśli kogoś interesują różne formy rządzenia w starożytnej grecji polecam jeśli nie nie polecam według mnie warto jednak zwrócić uwagę na kilka kwestii 1 pozwolenie na niewolnictwo ludzi którzy są niewolnikami z natury niestety arystoteles nie napisał dokładnie dlaczego natura jednych ludzi pozwala na zniewolenie innych nie ludzka natura jest jedna wszyscy jesteśmy ludźmi chyba że ktoś chce dobrowolnie zrzec swoich praw dlatego nie powinno być przyzwolenia na niewolnictwo 2 według autora procent jest zły ponieważ według niego pieniądze za pomocą procentu rodzą się co jest sprzeczne z naturą chciałbym zamieścić tutaj serię wulgaryzmów wyrażających moje oburzenie na ten idiotyzm jednak nie jest odpowiednie miejsce niestety w czasach arystotelesa nie było czegoś takiego jak ekonomia więc ludzie zazwyczaj uważali procent za zło jednak tak nie jest czym w takim razie jest procent procent jest premią za ryzyko oraz zapłatą za powstrzymanie się od konsumpcji przez pożyczkodawcę w austriackiej szkole ekonomii ase funkcjonuje takie pojęcie jak preferencja czasowa jest miara tego jak ludzie pożądają dobra teraźniejsze nad przyszłymi osoba z niską preferencją czasową jest skłonna więcej oszczędzać czyli powstrzymywać się teraźniejszej konsumpcji na rzecz przyszłej u osoby z wysoką preferencją czasową jest na odwrót czyli jest bardziej skłonna wydawania zadłużania się kosztem przyszłej konsumpcji oszczędności osoby niskiej preferencji czasowej są później inwestowane lub też odkładane w banku w swoich rozważaniach nie uwzględniam tworzenia pieniądza z niczego przez państwo ponieważ jest osobny temat dzięki temu osoba z wyższą preferencją czasową może wziąć pożyczkę procent właśnie jest zapłatą za powstrzymanie się od konsumpcji przez oszczędzającego jeśli pożyczę komuś 1000 zł ta osoba za tydzień mi je odda raczej nikt nie widzi w tym nic złego ale jeśli pożyczę komuś 1000 zł ta osoba odda mi dokładnie 1000 zł za 10 lat uważacie że jest w porządku przecież wierzyciel nie może korzystać z tych pieniędzy przez długi czas dodatkowo nie gwarancji na że ta osoba mu zwróci zatem dodatkowo taka osoba potrzebuje także premii za ryzyko ponieważ nie wszyscy jej dłużnicy będą wypłacalni dodatkowo oszczędzanie wspomaga akumulację kapitału co umożliwia coraz bardziej zaawansowane inwestycje produkcje coraz bardziej zaawansowanych dóbr bez tego nie było praktycznie rozwoju choćby zachodnia europa jest znacznie bogatsza od afryki właśnie dzięki znacznie wcześniejszemu rozpoczęciu akumulacji kapitału co było możliwe dzięki zmianie myślenia ludzi doprowadziło rewolucji przemysłowej znacznego wzrostu bogactwa wszystkich ludzi nie widzę nic niesprawiedliwego w pobieraniu procentu 3 arystoteles stwierdził w jednym miejscu że jak będziemy mieli cnotliwych ludzi przy władzy oddadzą oni władzę dobrowolnie ludziom bardziej cnotliwym jest oczywiście absurdalne dlaczego ktoś miałby dobrowolnie zrzec się przywilejów na rzecz kogoś innego 4 arystoteles w jednym miejscu przywołał pogląd według którego demokracja jest równoważna z wolnością nie jest prawdą wolność polega na tym że każdy może robić sobie co chce dopóki nie narusza wolności innych natomiast demokracja polega na tym że formują się różne grupy największa grupa nie większość obywateli jak mówią demokraci narzuca swoją wolę wszystkim innym grabi ich oczywiście inne grupy mogą przejąć władzę ale doprowadzi tylko zmiany kierunku grabieży demokracja w oczywisty sposób prowadzi chęci narzucania swojej woli oraz grabieży wszystkich przez wszystkich co zostało dobrze opisane w law napisanym przez frédéric bastiat które polecam przeczytać ktoś może oczywiście zapytać że skoro demokracja jest zła czym ją zastąpić według mnie najlepsze będzie państwo minimum które zajmowało się policją systemem prawnym wojskiem oraz polityką zagraniczną takie państwo powinno mieć zakaz mieszania się w prywatne sprawy ludzi oraz w gospodarkę jak będzie wybierać się urzędników których będzie oczywiście bardzo niewielu czy przez głosowanie obywateli czy coś innego jest sprawą drugorzędną 5 ostatnią rzeczą którą chcę tutaj wypomnieć arystotelesowi jest chęć naprawy człowieka przez państwową edukację dlaczego jakiś filozof miałby narzucać mi wyznawane przez mnie wartości w ostatnich czasach pojawiło się kilku takich panów hitler stalin lenin mao itd którzy próbowali zrealizować tą ideę zakończyło się tragicznie każdy z nas jest inny wyznaje inne wartości poza tym kto decydować tym co jest cnotliwe co nie nie da się ujednolicić ludzi ponieważ zawsze większość będzie się temu opierała jedynym wyjściem będzie wysyłanie takich ludzi gułagów obozów zagłady lepiej pozwolić ludziom działać nie ingerować dopóki nikt nie narusza wolności innych polecam przeczytać cnota egoizmu napisaną przez ayn rand było jeszcze wiele innych rakogennych fragmentów ale uznałem że nie będę się nich odnosił ponieważ są mniej rakogenne,liked it,3
